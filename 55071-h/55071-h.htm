<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the year 1851 news reached
California, that in the spring of that year a family by the name
of <span class="smcap">Oatman</span>, while endeavoring to reach
California by the old Santa Fe route, had met with a most melancholy
and terrible fate, about seventy miles from Fort Yuma. That while
struggling with every difficulty imaginable, such as jaded teams,
exhaustion of their stores of provisions, in a hostile and barren
region, alone and unattended, they were brutally set upon by a horde
of Apache savages; that seven of the nine persons composing their
family were murdered, and that two of the smaller girls were taken into
captivity.</p>

<p>One of the number, <span class="smcap">Lorenzo D. Oatman</span>, a
boy about fourteen, who was knocked down and left for dead, afterward
escaped, but with severe wounds and serious injury.</p>

<p>But of the girls, <span class="smcap">Mary Ann</span> and <span
class="smcap">Olive Ann</span>, nothing had since been heard, up to
last March. By a singular and mysteriously providential train of
circumstances, it was ascertained at that time, by persons living at
Fort Yuma, that one of these girls was then living among the Mohave
tribe, about four hundred miles from the fort. A ransom was offered
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
her by the ever-to-be-remembered and generous Mr. <span
class="smcap">Grinell</span>, then a mechanic at the fort; and through
the agency and tact of a Yuma Indian, she was purchased and restored to
civilized life, to her brother and friends. The younger of the girls,
<span class="smcap">Mary Ann</span>, died of starvation in 1852.</p>

<p>It is of the massacre of this family, the escape of <span
class="smcap">Lorenzo</span>, and the captivity of the two girls, that
the following pages treat.</p>

<p>A few months since the author of this book was requested by the
afflicted brother and son, who barely escaped with life, but not
without much suffering, to write the past history of the family;
especially to give a full and particular account of the dreadful and
barbarous scenes of the captivity endured by his sisters. This I have
tried to do. The facts and incidents have been received from the
brother and sister, now living.</p>

<p>These pages have been penned under the conviction that in these
facts, and in the sufferings and horrors that befell that unfortunate
family, there is sufficient of interest, though of a melancholy
character, to insure an attentive and interested perusal by every one
into whose hands, and under whose eye this book may fall. Though,
so far as book-making is concerned, there has been brought to this
task no experience or fame upon which to base an expectation of its
popularity, yet the writer has sought to adapt the style to the
character of the narrative, and in a simple, plain, comprehensive
manner to give to the reader facts, as they have been received from
those of whose sad experiences in adversity these pages give a faithful
delineation. In doing this he has sought plainness, brevity, and
an unadorned style, deeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"
id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> these the only excellences that could be
appropriately adopted for such a narrative; the only ones that he
expects will be awarded. It would be but a playing with sober, solemn,
and terrible reality to put the tinselings of romance about a narrative
of this kind. The <em>intrinsic</em> interest of the subject-matter here
thrown together, must have the credit of any circulation that shall be
given to the book. Upon this I am willing to rely; and that it will
be sufficient to procure a wide and general perusal, remunerating and
exciting, I have the fullest confidence. As for criticisms, while there
will, no doubt, be found occasions for them, they are neither coveted
nor dreaded. All that is asked is, that the reader will avail himself
of the <em>facts</em>, and dismiss, as far as he can, the garb they wear,
for it was not woven by one who has ever possessed a desire to become
experienced or skilled in that ringing, empty style which can only
charm for the moment, and the necessity for which is never felt but
when real matter and thought are absent.</p>

<p>That all, or any considerable portion, of the distress, mental and
physical, that befell that unfortunate family, the living as well
as dead, can be written or spoken, it would be idle to claim. The
desolation and privation to which little <span class="smcap">Mary
Ann</span> was consigned while yet but seven years old; the
abuse, the anguish, the suffering that rested upon the nearly two
years&#8217; captivity through which she passed to an untimely grave;
the unutterable anguish that shrouded with the darkness of despair
five years of her older sister; the six years of perpetual tossing
from transient hope to tormenting fears, and during which unceasing
toil and endeavor was endured by the elder<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> brother, who knew at that
time, and has ever since known, that two of his sisters were taken into
captivity by the Indians; these, all these are realities that are and
must forever remain unwritten. We would not, if we could, give to these
pages the power to lead the reader into all the paths of torture and
woe through which the last five years have dragged that brother and
sister, who yet live, and who, from hearts disciplined in affliction,
have herein dictated all of what they have felt that can be transferred
to the type. We would not, if we could, recall or hold up to the
reader the weight of parental solicitude or heart-yearnings for their
dear family that crowded upon the last few moments of reason allowed
to those fond parents, while in the power and under the war-clubs of
their Apache murderers. The heart&#8217;s deepest anguish, and its
profoundest emotions have no language. There is no color so deep that
pen dipped therein can portray the reality. If what may be here found
written of these unspoken woes shall only lead the favored subjects
of constant good fortune to appreciate their exempted allotment, and
create in their hearts a more earnest and practical sympathy for those
who tread the damp, uncheered paths of suffering and woe, then the
moral and social use prayed for and intended in these pages will be
secured.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> issuing the first edition of the
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Captivity of the Oatman Girls</span>,&#8221;
which obtained a rapid and quick sale, the author has been in the
northern part of the state, busy with engagements made previous to its
publication, and which he considered he had ample time to meet, and
return before another edition would be called for, if at all. But in
this he was mistaken. Only two weeks had elapsed before orders were
in the city for books, that could not be filled; and that but a few
days after the whole edition was bound. The first five thousand was
put out as an experiment, and with considerable abridgment from the
original manuscript as at first prepared. Considerable matter referring
to the customs of the Indians, and the geography and character of the
country, was left out to avoid the expense of publishing. Could we have
known that the first edition would have been exhausted so soon, this
omitted matter might have been re-prepared and put into this edition,
but the last books were sold when the author<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> was five hundred miles from
his present home, and on returning it was thought best to hurry this
edition through the press, to meet orders already on hand. We trust the
reader will find most, if not all, of the objectionable portions of the
first edition expunged from this; besides the insertion in their proper
places of some additions that were, without intention, left out of the
former one. He will also find this printed upon superior paper and
type; and in many ways improved in its appearance.</p>

<p>We must remind the reader, that in preparing a work like the
present there is an utter impropriety in resorting to any other than
the plainest matter-of-fact style. This book is not a romance. It is
not dependent upon an exorbitant fictitiousness of expression for
enlisting the attention or interest of the sober reader. The <em>scene</em> is
a reality. The <em>heroes</em> of the tale are living. Let those, if any there
are, to whom <em>reality</em> is a serious obstacle to engaged and sustained
attention and interest, and whose morbidly created taste, has given
a settled disrelish for marvels <em>in the facts</em>, while it unceasingly
clamors for miracles of the fancy; to whom plain things, said in a
plain way, have no attraction, whose reading heaven is a mountain of
epithet on flashing epithet piled&mdash;let such lay aside the book.</p>

<p>The writer does not disclaim literary taste. Such a taste it
is confidently felt is not herein violated. For <em>its display</em>
these pages are not intended. These remarks are here penned for
the reason that in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"
id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> instances, instead of an open criticism,
founded upon the reading of the book, there has been a construing of
the frank avowal of the <em>real intention</em> of this book, made in a former
preface, into a confession of a literary weakness in the composition
of this work. The writer for the last eleven years has been engaged in
public speaking, and though moving contentedly in an humble sphere, is
not without <em>living</em> testimonials to his <em>diligence</em> and <em>fidelity</em>, at
least in application to those literary studies and helps to his calling
which were within his reach. With a present consciousness of many
imperfections in this respect, he is nevertheless not forbidden by a
true modesty to say, that in a laudable ambition to acquire and command
the <em>pure English, from the root upward</em>, he has not been wholly
negligent nor unsuccessful; nor in the habit of earnest and particular
observation of men and things has he been without his note-book and
open eyes.</p>

<p>During the years spoken of he has seldom appeared before the public
without a carefully written compendium, and often a full manuscript of
the train of thought to be discoursed upon.</p>

<p>But still, if his attainments were far more than are here claimed,
it would by some be judged a poor place to use them for the feasting of
the reader of a book of the nature of this record of murder, wailing,
captivity, and horrid separations.</p>

<p>The notices in the papers referred to have, no doubt, grown
from a habit that prevails to a great extent, of writing a notice
of a new book from a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> glance at a preface. Hence, he who
can gyrate in a brilliant circle of polished braggadocio in his
first-born, is in a fair way to meet the echo of his own words, and be
&#8220;<em>puffed!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>But, unpretending as are these pages, the author, in his own behalf,
and in behalf of those for and of whom he writes, is under many
obligations to the press of the State. In many instances a careful
perusal has preceded a public printed notice by an editor; and with
some self-complacency he finds that such notices have been the most
flattering and have done most to hasten the sale of these books.</p>

<p>The author, still making no pretensions to a serving up of a repast
for the literary taste, yet with confidence assures the reader that he
will find nothing upon these pages that can offend such a taste.</p>

<p>Let it be said further, that the profits accruing from the sale
of this work are, so far as the brother and sister are concerned, to
be applied to those who need help. It was with borrowed means that
Mr. Oatman published the first edition, and it is to secure means to
furnish himself and his sister with the advantages of that education
which has been as yet denied, that the narrative of their five
years&#8217; privation is offered to the reading public. Certainly,
if the eye or thought delights not to wander upon the page of their
sufferings, the heart will delight to think of means expended for the
purchase of the book that details them.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second edition of this book (six
thousand copies) was nearly exhausted in the California and Oregon
trade within a few months after its publication. Numerous friends
and relatives of Mr. and Miss Oatman, who had received copies of the
work from friends in California, wrote to the writer, and also to the
Oatmans, urgently requesting its publication for circulation in the
Atlantic and Western States.</p>

<p>They had read the book, and loaned it to neighbors and friends,
until each copy numbered a considerable circle of readers, and an
almost unanimous opinion had been expressed that the book would meet
with a large and ready sale if it could be put into the market at
prices ruling on this side of the continent.</p>

<p>In behalf of those for whose special benefit the book is
published, the writer can but feel grateful for the large sales
that in a few weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14"
id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> were effected in California. Eleven
thousand were sold there in a short time, and the owner of the book has
deeply regretted that it was not stereotyped at the first.</p>

<p>Recently, to meet demands for the book already existing, especially
in some of the Western States, where the Oatman family were well known,
it was resolved to publish the book in New-York, in an improved style,
and with the addition of some incidents that were prepared for the
California issue, but omitted from the necessity of the case.</p>

<p>The reader will find the book much improved in its intrinsic
interest by the addition of these geographical, traditional, and
historic items. The matter added is chiefly of the peculiar traditions
and superstitions of the tribes who were the captors and possessors of
Miss Oatman. Three new illustrations are also added, and the old ones
newly drawn and engraved. Every plate has been enlarged, and the work
done in a much improved and more perfect style.</p>

<p>The reader will find this book to be a record of <em>facts</em>; and these
are of the most thrilling, some of them of the most horrid nature. Of
all the records of Indian captivities we feel<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> confident none have
possessed more interest than this. Numerous have been the testimonies
from California readers that it exceeds any of kindred tales that
have preceded it. The Oatman family were well and favorably known
in portions of Illinois and Pennsylvania, and a large circle of
acquaintances are waiting, with much anxiety, the issue from the
press of this narrative of the tragical allotment that they met after
starting for the Colorado in 1850. Seven of their number have fallen by
the cruelties of the Indian; two, a brother and sister, are now in this
city.</p>

<p>There are sketches and delineations in this volume touching the
region lying to the West and Southwest, as also of the large aboriginal
tribes that have so long held exclusive possession there, which, in
these times of the unparalleled westward-pushing propensities of our
people, are clothed with new and startling interest day by day.</p>

<p>In the purchase of this book the reader will add to his private
or family library a volume whose chief attraction will not be
merely in the detail of horrors, of suffering, of cruel captivity,
which it brings to him; but one which his children will find
valuable for reference in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> the years they may live to see, and
which are to be crowded, doubtless, with an almost total revolution
in the humanities that people the region lying between the Pacific
and Texas, and between Oregon and Mexico. These dark Indian tribes
are fast wasting before the rising sun of our civilization; and into
<em>that history</em> that is yet <em>to be written</em> of their past, and of their
destiny, and of the many interlacing events that are to contribute to
the fulfilling of the wise intent of Providence concerning them and
their only dreaded foe, the white race, facts and incidents contained

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> 9th of August,
1850, was a lovely day. The sun had looked upon the beautiful plains
surrounding Independence, Missouri, with a full, unclouded face, for
thirteen hours of that day; when, standing about four miles south
of westward from the throbbing city of Independence, alive with
the influx and efflux of emigrant men and women, the reader, could
he have occupied that stand, might have seen, about one half hour
before sunset, an emigrant train slowly<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> approaching him from the
city. This train consisted of about twenty wagons, a band of emigrant
cattle, and about fifty souls, men, women, and children. Attended by
the music of lowing cattle, and the chatter of happy children, it was
slowly traversing a few miles, at this late hour of the day, to seek
a place of sufficient seclusion to enable them to hold the first and
preparatory night&#8217;s camp away from the bustle and confusion of
the town.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was gladdening the clear west, and throwing its
golden farewells upon the innumerable peaks that stretched into a
forest of mountains gradually rising until they seemed to lean against
the sun-clad shoulders of the Rocky Range, imparadising the whole plain
and mountain country in its radiant embrace, the shrill horn of the
leader and captain suddenly pealed through the moving village, a circle
was formed, and the heads of the several families were in presence of
the commander, waiting orders for the camping arrangements for the
night.</p>

<p>Soon teams were detached from the wagons, and with the cattle (being
driven for commencement in a new country) were turned forth upon the
grass. Rich and abundant pasturage was stretching from the place of
their halt westward, seemingly until it bordered against the foot-hills
of the Indian territory in the distance.</p>

<p>Among the fifty souls that composed that emigrant band, some
were total strangers. Independence had<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> been selected as the
gathering-place of all who might heed a call that had been published
and circulated for months, beating up for volunteers to an emigrant
company about seeking a home in the Southwest. It was intended, as
the object and destination of this company, to establish an American
colony near the mouth of the Gulf of California. Inducements had been
held out, that if the region lying about the juncture of the Colorado
and Gila Rivers could thus be colonized, every facility should be
guaranteed the colonists for making to themselves a comfortable and
luxuriant home.</p>

<p>After a frugal meal, served throughout the various divisions of the
camp, the evening of the 9th was spent in perfecting regulations for
the long and dangerous trip, and in the forming of acquaintances, and
the interchange of salutations and gratulations.</p>

<p>Little groups, now larger and now smaller, by the constant moving
to and fro of members of the camp, had chatted the evening up to a
seasonable bedtime. Then, at the call of the &#8220;crier,&#8221;
all were collected around one camp-fire for the observance of public
worship, which was conducted by a clergyman present. Into that hour
of earnest worship were crowded memories of the home-land and friends
<em>now</em> forever abandoned for a settlement in the &#8220;far-off
Southwest.&#8221; There flowed and mingled the tear of regret and of
hope; there and then rose the earnest prayer for Providential guidance;
and at that hour there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"
id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> swelled out upon the soft, clear air of
as lovely an evening as ever threw its star-lit curtain upon hill and
vale, the song of praise and the shout of triumph, not alone in the
prospect of a home by the Colorado of the South, but of glad exultation
in the prospect of a home hard by the &#8220;River of Life,&#8221;
which rose to view as the final termination of the journeyings and toil
incident to mortality&#8217;s pilgrimage.</p>

    <p>FIRST NIGHT&#8217;S ENCAMPMENT.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now the hush of sleep&#8217;s wonted hour has stolen slowly over the
entire encampment, and nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25"
id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> without indicates remaining life, save the
occasional growl of the ever-faithful watch-dog, or the outburst of
some infant member of that villa-camp, wearied and worn, and overtasked
by the hurry and bustle of the previous day.</p>

<p>Reader, we now wish you to go with us into that camp, and receive an
introduction to an interesting family consisting of father, mother, and
seven children; the oldest of this juvenile group a girl of sixteen,
the youngest a bright little boy of one year. Silence is here, but
to that household sleep has no welcome. The giant undertaking upon
which they are now fairly launched is so freighted with interest to
themselves and their little domestic kingdom, as to leave no hour
during the long night for the senses to yield to the soft dominion
of sleep. Besides, this journey now before them has been preceded by
lesser ones, and these had been so frequent and of such trivial result
as that vanity seemed written upon all the deep and checkered past,
with its world of toil and journeyings. In a subdued whisper, but with
speaking countenances and sparkling eyes, these parents are dwelling
upon this many-colored by-gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Oatman is a medium-sized man, about five feet in height,
black hair, with a round face, and yet in the very prime of life.
Forty-one winters had scarcely been able to plow the first furrow of
age upon his manly cheek. Vigorous, healthy, and of a jovial turn of
mind, predisposed to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26"
id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> only upon the bright side of everything,
he was happy; of a sanguine temperament, he was given to but little
fear, and seemed ever drinking from the fresh fountains of a living
buoyant hope. From his boyhood he had been of a restless, roving
disposition, fond of novelty, and anxious that nothing within all the
circuit of habitable earth should be left out of the field of his ever
curious and prying vision.</p>

<p>He had been favored with rare educational advantages during his
boyhood, in Western New-York. These advantages he had improved with a
promising vigilance until about nineteen years of age. He then became
anxious to see, and try his fortune in, the then far away West. The
thought of emigrating had not been long cogitated by his quick and
ready mind, ere he came to a firm resolution to plant his feet upon one
of the wild prairies of Illinois.</p>

<p>He was now of age, and his father and mother, Lyman and Lucy Oatman,
had spent scarcely one year keeping hotel in Laharpe, Illinois, ere
they were joined by their son Royse.</p>

<p>Soon after going to Illinois, Royse was joined in marriage to
Miss Mary Ann Sperry, of Laharpe. Miss Sperry was an intelligent
girl of about eighteen, and, by nature and educational advantages,
abundantly qualified to make her husband happy and his home an
attraction. She was sedate, confiding, and affectionate, and in social
accomplishments placed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> by her peculiar advantages, above most of
those around her. From childhood she had been the pride of fond and
wealthy parents; and it was their boast that she had never merited a
rebuke for any wrong. The first two years of this happy couple was
spent on a farm near Laharpe. During this time some little means had
been accumulated by an honest industry and economy, and these means
Mr. Oatman collected, and with them embarked in mercantile business in
Laharpe.</p>

<p>Honesty, industry, and a number of years of thorough business
application, won for him the esteem of those around him, procured a
comfortable home for his family, and placed him in possession of a
handsome fortune, with every arrangement for its rapid increase. At
that time the country was rapidly filling up; farmers were becoming
rich, and substantial improvements were taking the place of temporary
modes of living which had prevailed as yet.</p>

<p>Paper money became plenty, the products of the soil had found a
ready and remunerative market, and many were induced to invest beyond
their means in real estate improvements.</p>

<p>The banks chartered about the years 1832 and 1840, had issued bills
beyond their charters, presuming upon the continued rapid growth
of the country to keep themselves above disaster. But business,
especially in times of speculation, like material substance, is of
a gravitating tendency, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> without a basis soon falls. A severe
reverse in the tendency of the markets spread rapidly over the entire
West during the year 1842. Prices of produce fell to a low figure. An
abundance had been raised, and the market was glutted. Debts of long
standing became due, and the demand for their payment became more
imperative, as the inability of creditors became more and more apparent
and appalling. The merchant found his store empty, his goods having
been credited to parties whose sole reliance was the usual ready market
for the products of their soil.</p>

<p>Thus, dispossessed of goods and destitute of money, the trading
portion of community were thrown into a panic, and business of all
kinds came to a stand-still. The producing classes were straitened;
their grain would not meet current expenses, for it had no market
value; and with many of them mortgages, bearing high interest, were
preying like vultures upon their already declining realities.</p>

<p>Specie was scarce. Bills were returned to the banks, and while a
great many of them were yet out the specie was exhausted, and a general
crash came upon the banks, while the country was yet flooded with what
was appropriately termed &#8220;the wild-cat money.&#8221; The day
of reckoning to these spurious money fountains suddenly weighed them
in the balances and found them wanting. Mr. Oatman had collected in
a large amount of this paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> currency, and was about to go South to
replenish his mercantile establishment, when lo! the banks began to
fail, and in a few weeks he found himself sunk by the weight of several
thousands into utter insolvency.</p>

<p>He was disappointed but not disheartened. To him a reverse was
the watchword for a renewal of energy. For two or three years he had
been in correspondence with relatives residing in Cumberland Valley,
Pennsylvania, who had been constantly holding up that section of
country as one of the most inviting and desirable for new settlers.</p>

<p>In a few weeks he had disposed of the fragments of a suddenly
shattered fortune to the greatest possible advantage to his creditors,
and resolved upon an immediate removal to that valley. In two months
preparations were made, and in three months, with a family of five
children, he arrived among his friends in Cumberland Valley, with a
view of making that a permanent settlement.</p>

<p>True to the domineering traits of his character, he was still
resolute and undaunted. His wife was the same trusting, cheerful
companion as when the nuptial vow was plighted, and the sun
of prosperity shone full upon and crowned their mutual toils.
Retired, patient, and persevering, she was a faithful wife and a
fond mother, in whom centered deservingly the love of a growing
and interesting juvenile group. She became more and more endeared
to her fortune-taunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> husband as adverse vicissitudes had
developed her real worth, and her full competence to brave and profit
by the stern battles of life.</p>

<p>She had seen her husband when prospered, and flattered by those
whose attachments had taken root in worldly considerations only; she
had stood by him also when the chilling gusts of temporary adversity
had blown the cold damps of cruel reserve and fiendish suspicion about
his name and character; and</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;When envy&#8217;s sneer would coldly blight his name,</p>
<p>And busy tongues were sporting with his fame,</p>
<p>She solved each doubt, and clear&#8217;d each mist away,</p>
<p>And made him radiant in the face of day.&#8221;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>They had spent but a few months in Pennsylvania, the place of their
anticipated abode for life, ere Mr. Oatman found it, to him, an unfit
and unsuitable place, as also an unpromising region in which to rear a
family. He sighed again for the wide, wild prairie lands of the West.
He began to regret that a financial reversion should have been allowed
so soon to drive him from a country where he had been accustomed to
behold the elements and foundation of a glorious and prosperous future;
and where those very religious and educational advantages&mdash;to
him the indispensable accompaniments of social progress&mdash;were
already beginning to shoot forth in all the vigor and promise of a
healthful and undaunted growth. He was not of that class who can
persist in an enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> merely from pride that is so weak as to
scorn the confession of a weakness; though he was slow to change his
purpose, only as a good reason might discover itself under the light
and teachings of multiplying circumstances around him.</p>

<p>He resolved to retrace his steps, and again to try his hands and
skill upon some new and unbroken portion of the State where he had
already <em>made</em> and <em>lost</em>. Early in 1845 these parents, with a family
of five children, destitute but courageous, landed in Chicago. There,
for one year, they supported with toil of head and hand (the father was
an experienced school teacher) their growing family.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1846 there might have been seen standing, at about
five miles from Fulton, Ill., and about fifteen from New-Albany, alone
in the prairie, a temporary, rude cabin. Miles of unimproved land
stretched away on either side, save a small spot, rudely fenced, near
the cabin, as the commencement of a home. At the door of this tent, in
April of that year, and about sunset, a wagon drawn by oxen, and driven
by the father of a family, a man about thirty-seven, and his son, a
lad about ten years, halted. That wagon contained a mother&mdash;a
woman of thirty-three years&mdash;toil-worn but contented, with five
of her children. The oldest son, Lorenzo, who had been plodding on
at the father&#8217;s side, dragged his weary limbs up to the cabin
door, and begged admittance for the night. This was readily and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
hospitably granted. Soon the family were transported from the
movable to the staid habitation. Here they rested their stomachs
upon &#8220;Johnny cake&#8221; and Irish potatoes, and their weary,
complaining bodies upon the soft side of a white oak board for the
night.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours had not passed ere the father had staked out a
&#8220;claim;&#8221; a tent had been erected; the cattle turned forth,
were grazing upon the hitherto untrodden prairie land, and preparations
made and measures put into vigorous operation for spring sowing.
Here, with that same elasticity of mind and prudent energy that had
inspired his earliest efforts for self-support, Mr. Oatman commenced
to provide himself a home, and to surround his family with all the
comforts and conveniences of a subsistence. Before his energetic and
well-directed endeavors, the desert soon began to blossom; and beauty
and fruitfulness gradually stole upon these hitherto wild and useless
regions. He always managed to provide his family with a plain, frugal,
and plenteous support.</p>

<p>Four years and over Mr. and Mrs. Oatman toiled early and late,
clearing, subduing, and improving. And during this time they
readily and cheerfully turned their hands to any laudable calling,
manual or intellectual, that gave promise of a just remuneration
for their services. Although accustomed, for the most part of
their united life, to a competence that had placed them above
the necessity of menial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> service, yet they scorned a dependence
upon past position, as also that pride and utter recklessness of
principle which can consent to keep up the <em>exterior</em> of opulence,
while its expenses must come from unsecured and deceived creditors.
They contentedly adapted themselves to a manner and style that was
intended to give a true index to their real means and resources.</p>

<p>It was this principle of noble self-reliance, and unbending
integrity, that won for them the warmest regards of the good, and
crowned their checkered allotment with appreciative esteem wherever
their stay had been sufficient to make them known.</p>

<p>While the family remained at this place, now called Henly, they
toiled early and late, at home or abroad, as opportunity might offer.
During much of this time, however, Mr. Oatman was laboring under and
battling with a serious bodily infirmity and indisposition.</p>

<p>Early in the second year of their stay at Henly, while lifting a
stone, in digging a well for a neighbor, he injured himself, and from
the effects of that injury he never fully recovered.</p>

<p>At this time improvements around him had been conducted to a stage
of advancement that demanded a strict and vigilant oversight and
guidance. And though by these demands, and his unflagging ambition,
he was impelled to constant, and at times to severe labors, yet they
were labors for which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"
id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> been disabled, and from which he should
have ceased. Each damp or cold season of the year, after receiving this
injury to his back and spine, would place him upon a rack of pain,
and at times render life a torture. The winters, always severe in
that section of the country, that had blasted and swept away frailer
constitutions about him, had as yet left no discernible effects upon
his vigorous physical system. But now their return almost disabled him
for work, and kindled anew the torturing local inflammation that his
injury had brought with it to his system.</p>

<p>He became convinced that if he would live to bless and educate his
family, or would enjoy even tolerable health, he must immediately seek
a climate free from the sudden and extreme changes so common to the
region in which he had spent the last few years.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1849 an effort was made to induce a party to
organize, for the purpose of emigration to that part of the New-Mexican
Territory lying about the mouth of the Rio Colorado and Gila Rivers.
Considerable excitement extended over the northern and western
portions of Illinois concerning it. There were a few men, men of
travel and information, who were well acquainted with the state of the
country lying along the east side of the northern end of the Gulf of
California, and they had received the most flattering inducements to
form there a colony of the Anglo-Saxon people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35"
id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly notices were circulated of the number desired and
of the intention and destiny of the undertaking. The country was
represented as of a mild, bland climate, where the extremes of a hot
summer and severe winter were unknown. Mr. Oatman, after considerable
deliberation upon the state of his health, the necessity for a change
of climate, the reliability of the information that had come from this
new quarter, and other circumstances having an intimate connection with
the welfare of those dependent upon him, sent in his name, as one who,
with a family, nine in all, was ready to join the colony; and again he
determined to attempt his fortune in a new land.</p>

<p>He felt cheered in the prospect of a location where he might again
enjoy the possibility of a recovery of his health. And he hoped that
the journey itself might aid the return of his wonted vigor and
strength.</p>

<p>After he had proposed a union with this projected colony, and his
proposition had been favorably received, he immediately sold out. The
sum total of the sales of his earthly possessions amounted to fifteen
hundred dollars. With this he purchased an outfit, and was enabled to
reserve to himself sufficient, as he hoped, to meet all incidental
expenses of the tedious trip.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1850, accompanied by some of his neighbors,
who had also thrown their lots into this<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> scheme, he started for
Independence, the place selected for the gathering of the scattered
members of the colony, preparatory to a united travel for the point
of destination. Every precaution had been taken to secure unanimity
of feeling, purpose, and intention among those who should propose to
cast in their lot with the emigrating colony. All were bound for the
same place; all were inspired by the same object; all should enter the
band on an equality; and it was agreed that every measure of importance
to the emigrant army, should be brought to the consideration and
consultation of every member of the train.</p>

<p>It was intended to form a new settlement, remote from the
prejudices, pride, arrogance, and caste that obtain in the more opulent
and less sympathizing portions of a stern civilization. Many of the
number thought they saw in the locality selected many advantages that
were peculiar to it alone. They looked upon it as the way by which
emigration would principally reach this western gold-land, furnishing
for the colony a market for their produce; that thus remote they could
mold, fashion, and direct the education, habits, customs, and progress
of the young and growing colony, after a model superior to that under
which some of them had been discontentedly raised, and one that should
receive tincture, form, and adaptation from the opening and multiplying
necessities of the <em>experiment in progress</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>As above stated, this colony, composed of more than fifty souls,
encamped on the lovely evening of August 9, 1850, about four miles from
Independence.</p>

<p>The following are the names of those who were the most active in
projecting the movement, and their names are herein given, because they
may be again alluded to in the following pages; besides, many of them
are now living, and this may be the first notice they shall receive of
the fate of the unfortunate family, the captivity and sufferings of
the only two surviving members of which are the themes of these pages.
Mutual perils and mutual adventures have a power to cement worthy
hearts that is not found in unmingled prosperity. And it has been the
privilege of the author to know, from personal acquaintance, in one
instance, of a family to whom the &#8220;Oatman Family&#8221; were
bound by the tie of mutuality of suffering and geniality of spirit.</p>

<div class="nospace">
<p>Mr. Ira Thompson and family.</p>
<p>A. W. Lane and family.</p>
<p>R. and John Kelly and their families.</p>
<p>Mr. Mutere and family.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilder and family.</p>
<p>Mr. Brinshall and family.</p>
</div>

<p>We have thus rapidly sketched the outlines of the history of the
Oatman family, for a few years preceding their departure from the
eastern side of the continent, and glanced at the nature and cast
of their allotment, because of members of that family these<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> pages
are designed mainly to treat. This remove, the steps to which have
been traced above, proved their last; for though bright, and full
of promise and hope, at the outset, tragedy of the most painful and
gloomy character settles down upon it at an early period, and with
fearfully portentous gloom, thickens and deepens upon its every step,
until the day, so bright at dawn, gradually closes in all the horror
and desolation of a night of plunder, murder, and worse than murderous
and barbarous captivity. And though no pleasant task to bring this sad
afterpart to the notice of the reader, it is nevertheless a tale that
may be interesting for him to ponder; and instructive, as affording
matter for the employment of reflection, and instituting a heartier
sympathy with those upon whose life the clouds and pangs of severe
reverses and misfortunes have rested.</p>

<p>Ere yet twilight had lifted the deepest shades of night from plain
and hill-side, on the morning of the 10th of August, 1850, there was
stir and bustle, and hurrying to and fro throughout that camp. As
beautiful a sunrise as ever mantled the east, or threw its first,
purest glories upon a long and gladdened West, found all things in
order, and that itinerant colony arranged, prepared, and in march
for the &#8220;Big Bend&#8221; of the Arkansas River. Their course
at first lay due west, toward the Indian territory. One week passed
pleasantly away. Fine weather, vigorous teams, social, cheerful
chit-chat, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"
id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> evenings were passed by men, women, and
children, who had been thrown into their first acquaintance under
circumstances so well calculated to create identity of interest and
aim, all contributed to the comfort of this anxious company during the
&#8220;first week upon the plains,&#8221; and to render the prospect
for the future free from the first tint of evil adversity. At the end
of a week, and when they had made about one hundred miles, a halt was
called at a place known as the &#8220;Council Grove.&#8221; This place
is on the old Santa F&eacute; road, and is well suited for a place of
rest, and for recruiting. Up to this time naught but harmony and good
feeling prevailed throughout the ranks of this emigrant company. While
tarrying at this place, owing to the peculiarities in the religious
notions and prejudices of a few restless spirits, the first note of
discord and jarring element was introduced among them.</p>

<p>Some resolved to return, but the more sober (and such seemed in
the majority) persisted in the resolve to accomplish the endeared
object of the undertaking. Owing to their wise counsels, and moderate,
dignified management, peace and quiet returned; and after a tarry of
about one week&#8217;s duration, they were again upon their journey.
From Council Grove the road bore a little south of west, over a
beautiful level plain, covered with the richest pasturage; and in the
distance bordering on every hand against high, picturesque ranges of
mountains, seeming like so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"
id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> many huge blue bulwarks, and forming
natural boundaries between the abodes of the respective races, each
claiming, separately and apart, the one the mountain, the other the
vale.</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful; the evenings, cool and invigorating,
furnishing to the jaded band a perfect elysium for the recruiting of
tired nature, at the close of each day&#8217;s sultry and dusty toil.
Good feeling restored, all causes of irritation shut out, joyfully,
merrily, hopefully, the pilgrim band moved on to the Big Bend, on the
Arkansas River. Nothing as yet had been met to excite fear for personal
safety; nothing to darken for a moment the cloudless prospect that had
inspired and shone upon their first westward movings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was our custom,&#8221; says Lorenzo Oatman, &#8220;to lay
by on the Sabbath, both to rest physical nature, and also, by proper
religious services, to keep alive in our minds the remembrance of our
obligations to our great and kind Creator and Preserver, and to remind
ourselves that we were each travelers upon that great level of time, to
a bourne from whence no traveler returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>One Saturday night the tents were pitched upon the hither bank of
the Arkansas River. On the next morning Divine service was conducted
in the usual manner, and at the usual hour. Scarcely had the service
terminated ere a scene was presented calculated to interrupt the
general monotony, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41"
id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> awaken some not very agreeable
apprehensions for their personal safety. A Mr. Mutere was a short
way from the camp, on the other side of the river, looking after the
stock. While standing and gazing about him, the sound of crude, wild
music broke upon his ear. He soon perceived it proceeded from a band
of Indians, whom he espied dancing and singing in the wildest manner
in a grove near by. They were making merry, as if in exultation over
some splendid victory. He soon ascertained that they were of the
Camanche tribe, and about them were a number of very beautiful American
horses and mules. He knew them to be stolen stock, from the saddle and
harness marks, yet fresh and plainly to be seen. While Mr. Mutere stood
looking at them his eye suddenly fell upon a huge, hideous looking
&#8220;buck,&#8221; partly concealed behind a tree, out from which he
was leveling a gun at himself. He sprang into a run, much frightened,
and trusted to leg bail for a safe arrival at camp.</p>

<p>At this the Indian came out, hallooed to Mutere, and made the
most vehement professions of friendship, and of the absence of
all evil design toward him. But Mutere chose not to tarry for any
reassurance of his kindly interest in his welfare. As soon as Mutere
was in camp, several Indians appeared upon the opposite side of the
river, hallooing, and asking the privilege of coming into camp,
avowing friendliness. After a little their request was granted,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> and
about a score of them came up near the camp. The party soon had
occasion to mark their folly in yielding to the request of the Indians,
who were not long in their vicinity ere they were observed in secret
council a little apart, also at the same time bending their bows
and making ready their arrows, as if upon the eve of some malicious
intent. &#8220;At this,&#8221; says L. Oatman, &#8220;our boys were
instantly to their guns, and upon the opposite side of the wagon,
preparing them for the emergence. But we took good care to so hide us,
as to let our motions plainly appear to the enemy, that they might
take warning from our courage and not be apprised of our fears. Our
real intention was immediately guessed at, as we could see by the
change in the conduct of our new enemy. They, by this time, lowered
their bows, and their few guns, and modestly made a request for a
cow. This roused our resolution, and the demand was quickly resisted.
We plainly saw unmistakable signs of fear, and a suspicion that they
were standing a poor show for cow-beef from that quarter. Such was
the first abrupt close that religious services had been brought to
on our whole route as yet. These evil-designing wretches soon made
off, with more dispatch evidently than was agreeable. A few hours
after they again appeared upon the opposite bank, with about a score
of fine animals, which they drove to water in our sight. As soon as
the stock had drank, they raised a whoop, gave us some hearty<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
cheering, and were away to the south at a tremendous speed. On Monday
we crossed the river, and toward evening met a government train, who
had been out to the fort and were now on their return. We related to
them what we had seen. They told us that they had, a day or two before,
come upon the remnant of a government train who were on their way to
the fort, that their stock had been taken from them, and they were left
in distress, and without means of return. They also informed us that
during the next day we would enter upon a desert, where for ninety
miles we would be without wood and water. This information, though
sad, was timely. We at once made all possible preparations to traverse
this old &#8216;Sahara&#8217; of the Santa F&eacute; road. But these
preparations as to water proved unnecessary, for while we were crossing
this desolate and verdureless waste, the kindly clouds poured upon us
abundance of fresh water, and each day&#8217;s travel for this ninety
miles was as pleasant as any of our trip to us, though to the stock it
was severe.&#8221;</p>

<p>While at the camp on the river one very tragical (?) event occurred,
which must not be omitted. One Mr. M. A. M., Jun., had stepped down
to the river bank, leisurely whistling along his way, in quest of
a favorable place to draw upon the Arkansas for a pail of water.
Suddenly two small girls, who had been a little absent from camp,
with aprons upon their heads, rose above a little mound, and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
presented themselves to his view. His busy brain must have been
preoccupied with &#8220;Injins,&#8221; for he soon came running,
puffing, and yelling into camp. As he went headlong over the
wagon-tongue, his tin pail as it rolled starting a half-score of dogs
to their feet, and setting them upon a yell, he lustily, and at the
topmost pitch of voice, cried, &#8220;Injins! Injins!&#8221; He soon
recovered his wits, however, and the pleasant little lasses came into
camp with a hearty laugh that they had so unexpectedly been made the
occasion of a rich piece of &#8220;fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the river bend or crossing, on to Moro, the first settlement
we reached in New Mexico, was about five hundred miles. During this
time nothing of special interest occurred to break the almost painful
monotony of our way, or ruffle the quiet of our <i>sociale</i>, save an
occasional family jar, the frequent crossing of pointed opinions, the
now-and-then prophecies of &#8220;Injins ahead,&#8221; etc., except
one &#8220;Grape Dumpling&#8221; affair, which must be related by
leaving a severe part untold. At one of our camps, on one of those fine
water-courses that frequently set upon our way, from the mountains, we
suddenly found ourselves near neighbors to a bounteously burdened grape
orchard. Of these we ate freely. One of our principal and physically
talented matrons, however, like the distrustful Israelites, determined
not to trust to to-morrow for to-morrow&#8217;s manna. She accordingly
laid in a more than night&#8217;s supply.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> The over-supply was, for
safe keeping, done up &#8220;brown,&#8221; in the form of well-prepared
and thoroughly-cooked dumplings, and these deposited in a cellar-like
stern end of the &#8220;big wagon.&#8221; Unfortunate woman! if she
had only performed these hiding ceremonies when the lank eye of one
of our invalids, (?) Mr. A. P., had been turned the other way, she
might have prevented a calamity, kindred to that which befell the
<em>ancient</em> emigrants when they sought to lay by more than was demanded
by immediate wants.</p>

<p>Now this A. P. had started out sick, and since his restoration had
been constantly beleaguered by one of those dubious blessings, common
as vultures upon the plains, a voracious appetite, an appetite that,
like the grave, was constantly receiving yet never found a place to
say, &#8220;Enough.&#8221; Slowly he crawled from his bed, after he was
sure that sleep had made Mrs. M. oblivious of her darling dumplings,
and the rest of the camp unheedful of his movements, and, standing
at the stern of the wagon, he deliberately emptied almost the entire
contents of this huge dumpling pan into his ever-craving interior.</p>

<p>It seems that they had been safely stored in the wagon by this
provident matron, to furnish a feast for the passengers when their
travels might be along some grapeless waste; and but for the unnatural
cravings of the unregulated appetite of A. P., might still have
remained for that purpose. It was evident<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> the next day that the
invalid had been indulging in undue gluttony. He was &#8220;sick
again,&#8221; and, to use his own phrase, &#8220;like all backsliders,
through worldly or stomach prosperity and repletion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madam M. now seized a stake, and thoroughly caned him through the
camp, until dumpling strength was low, very low in the market.</p>

<p>After crossing the big desert, one day, while traveling, some
of our company had their notions of our personal safety suddenly
revolutionized under the following circumstances. A Mr. J. Thompson
and a young man, C. M., had gone one side of the road some distance,
hunting antelope. Among the hills, and when they were some distance
in advance of the camp, they came upon a large drove of antelopes.
They were ignorant at the time of their whereabouts, and the routed
game started directly toward the train; but, to the hunters, the train
seemed to be in directly the opposite direction. In the chase the
antelopes soon came in sight of the train, and several little girls
and boys, seeing them, and seeing their pursuers, ran upon a slight
elevation to frighten the antelopes back upon the hunters; whereupon,
by some unaccountable mirage deception, these little girls and boys
were suddenly transformed into huge Indians to the eyes of the hunters.
They were at once forgetful of their anticipated game, and regarding
themselves as set upon by a band of some giant race, began to devise
for their own escape. Mr. T.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"
id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> thinking that no mortal arm could rescue
them, turned at once, and with much perturbation, to the young man,
and vehemently cried out: &#8220;Charles, let us pray.&#8221; Said
Charles, &#8220;No, I&#8217;ll be d&mdash;d if I&#8217;ll pray; let
us run;&#8221; and at this he tried the valor of running. All the
exhortations of the old man to Charles &#8220;to drop his gun&#8221;
were as fruitless as his entreaties to prayer. But when Mr. T. saw
that Charles was making such rapid escape, he dropped his notions of
praying, and took to the pursuit of the path left by the running but
unpraying Charles. He soon outstripped the young man, and made him beg
most lustily of the old man &#8220;to wait, and not run away and leave
him there with the Injins alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chagrin of the brave hunters, after they had reached camp by
a long and circuitous route, may well be imagined, when they found
that they had been running from their own children; and that their
fright, and the running and fatigue it had cost them, had been well
understood by those of the camp who had been the innocent occasion of
their chase for antelopes suddenly being changed into a flight from
&#8220;Injins.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we came into the Mexican settlements our store of meats was
well-nigh exhausted, and we were gratefully surprised to find that at
every stopping place abundance of mutton was in market, fresh, and of
superior quality, and to be purchased at low rates. This constituted
our principal article of subsistence<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> during the time we were
traversing several hundred miles in this region.</p>

<p>Slowly, but with unmistakable indications of a melancholy character,
disaffection and disorder crept into our camp. Disagreements had
occurred among families. Those who had taken the lead in originating
the project had fallen under the ban and censure of those who, having
passed the novelty of the trip, were beginning to feel the pressure
of its dark, unwelcome, and unanticipated realities. And, in some
instances, a conduct was exhibited by those whose years and rank,
as well as professions made at the outset, created expectation and
confidence that in them would be found benefactors and wise counselors,
that tended to disgrace their position, expose the unworthiness of
their motives, and blast the bright future that seemed to hang over the
first steps of our journeyings. As a consequence, feelings of discord
were engendered, which gained strength by unwise and injudicious
counsels, until their pestilential effects spread throughout the
camp.</p>

<p>At Moro we tarried one night. This is a small Mexican town, of about
three hundred inhabitants, containing, as the only objects of interest,
a Catholic Mission station, now in a dilapidated state; a Fort,
well-garrisoned by Mexican soldiers, and a fine stream of water, that
comes, cool and clear, bounding down the mountain side, beautifying and
reviving this finely located village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49"
id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day after leaving this place we came to the Natural, or
Santa Fe Pass, and camped that night at the well-known place called the
Forks. From this point there is one road leading in a more southerly
direction, and frequently selected by emigrants after arriving at the
Forks, though the other road is said, by those best acquainted, to
possess many advantages. At this place we found that the disaffection,
which had appeared for some time before, was growing more and more
incurable; and it began to break out into a general storm. Several of
our number resolved upon taking the south road; but this resolution was
reached only as a means of separating themselves from the remainder
of the train; for the intention really was to become detached from
the restraints and counsels that they found interfering with their
uncontrollable selfishness. There seemed to be no possible method by
which these disturbing elements could be quelled. The matter gave rise
to an earnest consultation and discussion upon the part of the sober
and prudent portion of our little band; but all means and measures
proposed for an amicable adjustment of variances and divisions, seemed
powerless when brought in contact with the unmitigated selfishness
that, among a certain few, had blotted out from their view the one
object and system of regulation that they had been instrumental in
throwing around the undertaking at first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50"
id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>We now saw a sad illustration of the adage that &#8220;it is not
all gold that glitters.&#8221; The novelty of the scene, together with
every facility for personal comfort and enjoyment, may suffice to
spread the glad light of good cheer about the first few days or weeks
of an emigrating tour upon these dreary plains; but let its pathway be
found among hostile tribes for a number of weeks; let a scarcity of
provisions be felt; let teams begin to fail, with no time or pasturage
to recruit them; let inclement weather and swollen streams begin to
hedge up the way; these, and more that frequently becomes a dreadful
reality, have at once a wonderful power to turn every man into a
kingdom by himself, and to develop the real nature of the most hidden
motives of his being.</p>

<p>Several of those who had, with unwonted diligence and forbearance,
sought to restore quiet and satisfaction, but to no purpose, resolved
upon remaining here until the disaffected portion had selected the
direction and order of their own movements, and then quietly pursue
their way westward by the other route. After some delay, and much
disagreeable discussion among themselves, the northern route was
selected by the malcontents, and they commenced their travels apart.
The remainder of us started upon the south road; and though our animals
were greatly reduced, our social condition was greatly improved.</p>

<p>We journeyed on pleasantly for about one hundred<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> miles,
when we reached Socoro, a beautiful and somewhat thrifty Mexican
settlement. Our teams were now considerably jaded, and we found it
necessary to make frequent halts and tarryings for the purpose of
recruiting them. And this we found it the more difficult to do, as
we were reaching a season of the year, and section of country, that
furnished a scanty supply of feed. We spent one week at Socoro, for
the purpose of rest to ourselves and teams, as also to replenish, if
possible, our fast diminishing store of supplies. We found that food
was becoming more scarce among the settlements that lay along our line
of travel; that quality and price were likewise serious difficulties,
and that our wherewith to purchase even these was well-nigh
exhausted.</p>

<p>We journeyed from Socoro to the Rio Grande amid many and
disheartening embarrassments and troubles. Sections of the country were
almost barren; teams were failing, and indications of hostility among
the tribes of Indians (representatives of whom frequently gave us the
most unwelcome greetings) were becoming more frequent and alarming.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the Rio Grande, two fine horses were stolen
from Mr. Oatman. We afterward learned that they had been soon after
seen among the Mexicans, though by them the theft was attributed
to unfriendly neighboring tribes; and it was asserted that horses,
stolen from trains of emigrants, were frequently brought into
Mexican settlements and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> offered for sale. It is proper here to
apprise the reader, that the project of a settlement in New-Mexico had
now been entirely abandoned since the division mentioned above, and
that California had become the place where we looked for a termination
of our travel, and the land where we hoped soon to reach and find a
<em>home</em>. At the Rio Grande we rested our teams one week, as a matter
of necessary mercy, for every day we tarried was only increasing the
probability of the exhaustion of our provisions, ere we could reach
a place of permanent supply. We took from this point the &#8220;Cook
and Kearney&#8221; route, and found the grass for our teams for a
while more plentiful than for hundreds of miles previous. Our train
now consisted of eight wagons and twenty persons. We now came into a
mountainous country, and we found the frequent and severe ascents and
declivities wearing upon our teams beyond any of our previous travel.
We often consumed whole days in making less than one quarter of the
usual day&#8217;s advance. A few days after leaving the Rio Grande,
one Mr. Lane died of the mountain fever. He was a man highly esteemed
among the members of the train, and we felt his loss severely. We
dug a grave upon one of the foot hills, and with appropriate funeral
obsequies we lowered his remains into the same. Some of the female
members of our company planted a flower upon the mound that lifted
itself over his lonely grave. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53"
id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> rude stake, with his name and date of his
death inscribed upon it, was all we left to mark the spot of his last
resting-place. One morning, after spending a cool night in a bleak and
barren place, we awoke with several inches of snow lying about us upon
the hills in the distance. We had spent the night and a part of the
previous day without water. Our stock were scattered during the night,
and our first object, after looking them up, was to find some friendly
place where we might slake our thirst.</p>

<p>The morning was cold, with a fierce bleak wind setting in from the
north. Added to the pains of thirst, was the severity of the cold. We
found that the weather is subject, in this region, to sudden changes,
from one to the other extreme. While in this distressed condition some
of our party espied in the distance a streak of timber letting down
from the mountains, indicative of running living water. To go to this
timber we immediately made preparation, with the greatest possible
dispatch, as our only resort. And our half-wavering expectations were
more than realized; for after a most fatiguing trip of nearly a day,
during which many of us were suffering severely from thirst, we reached
the place, and found not only timber and water in abundance, but a
plentiful supply of game. Turkeys, deer, antelope, and wild sheep were
dancing through every part of the beautiful woodland that lured us
from our bleak mountain camp. As the weather continued extremely cold
we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
must have suffered severely, if we had not lost our lives, even, by
the severity of the weather, as there was not a particle of anything
with which to kindle a fire, unless we had used our wagon timber for
that purpose, had we not sought the shelter of this friendly grove. We
soon resolved upon at least one week&#8217;s rest in this place, and
arrangements were made accordingly. During the week we feasted upon the
most excellent wild meat, and spent most of our time in hunting and
fishing. Excepting the fear we constantly entertained concerning the
Indians of the neighborhood, we spent the week here very pleasantly.
One morning three large, fierce-looking Apaches came into camp at
an early hour. They put on all possible pretensions of friendship;
but from the first their movements were suspicious. They for a time
surveyed narrowly our wagon and teams, and, so far as allowed to do so,
our articles of food, clothing, guns, etc. Suspecting their intentions
we bade them be off, upon which they reluctantly left our retreat.
That night the dogs kept up a barking nearly the whole night, and at
seasons of the night would run to their masters, and then a short
distance into the wood, as if to warn us of the nearness of danger. We
put out our fires, and each man, with his arms, kept vigilant guard.
There is no doubt that by this means our lives were preserved. Tracks
of a large number of Indians were seen near the camp next morning; and
on going out we found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> twenty head of stock had been driven away,
some of which belonged to the teams. By this several of our teams were
so reduced that we found extreme difficulty in getting along. Some
of our wagons and baggage were left at a short distance from this in
consequence of what we here lost. We traced the animals some distance,
until we found the trail leading into the wild, difficult mountain
fastnesses, where it was dangerous and useless to follow.</p>

<p>We were soon gathered up, and en route again for &#8220;Ta
Bac,&#8221; another Mexican settlement, of which we had learned as
presenting inducements for a short recruiting halt.</p>

<p>We found ourselves again traveling through a rich pasturage country,
abounding with the most enchanting, charming scenery that had greeted
us since we had left the &#8220;Big Bend.&#8221; We came into &#8220;Ta
Bac&#8221; with better spirits, and more vigorous teams, than was
allowed us during the last few hundred miles.</p>

<p>At this place one of our number became the unwilling subject of a
most remarkable and dampening transaction. Mrs. M., of &#8220;grape
dumpling&#8221; notoriety, while bearing her two hundred and forty
of avoirdupois about the camp at rather a too rapid rate, suddenly
came in sight of a well that had been dug years before by the Mexican
settlers.</p>

<p>While guiding her steps so as to shun this huge-looking hole,
suddenly she felt old earth giving way beneath her. It proved that
a well of more ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56"
id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> date than the one she was seeking to shun
had been dug directly in her way, but had accumulated a fine covering
of grass during the lapse of years. The members of the camp, who were
lazily whiling away the hours on the down hill-side of the well&#8217;s
mouth, were soon apprised of the fact that some <em>momentous</em> cause had
interfered with nature&#8217;s laws, and opened some new and hitherto
unseen fountains in her bosom. With the sudden disappearance of Mrs.
M., there came a large current of clear cold water flowing through
the camp, greatly dampening our joys, and starting us upon the alert
to inquire into the cause of this strange phenomenon. Mrs. M. we soon
found safely lodged in the old well, but perfectly secure, as the
water, on the principle that two bodies cannot occupy the same space at
the same time, had leaped out as Mrs. M.&#8217;s mammoth proportions
had suddenly laid an imperative possessory injunction upon the entire
dimensions of the &#8220;hole in the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>We found, after leaving Ta Bac, the road uneven; the rains had
set in; the nights were cold; and evidences of the constant nearness
and evil designs of savage tribes were manifested every few miles
that we passed over. Several once rich, but now evacuated, Mexican
towns were passed, from which the rightful owners of the soil had
been driven by the Apaches. At &#8220;Santa Cruz&#8221; we found a
Mexican settlement of about one hundred inhabitants, friendly,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> and
rejoiced to see us come among them, as they were living constantly in
fear of the implacable Apaches, whose depredations were frequent and of
most daring and outrageous character. Almost every day bands of these
miscreant wretches were in sight upon the surrounding hills waiting
favorable opportunities for the perpetration of deeds of plunder and
death. They would at times appear near to the Mexican herdsmen, and
tauntingly command them &#8220;to herd and take care of those cattle
for the Apaches.&#8221; We found the country rich and desirable, but
for its being infested by these desperadoes. We learned, both from the
Mexicans and the conduct of the Indians themselves, that one American
placed them under more dread and fear than a score of Mexicans.
If along this road we were furnished with a fair representation,
these Mexicans are an imbecile, frail, cowardly, and fast declining
race. By the friendliness and generosity of the settlers at this
point, we made a fine recruit while tarrying there. For a while we
entertained the project of remaining for a year. Probably, had it not
been for the prowling savages, whose thieving, murdering banditti
infest field and woodland, we might have entered into negotiations
with the Mexicans to this effect; but we were now en route for the
Eureka of the Pacific Slope, and we thought we had no time to waste
between us and the realization of our golden dreams. Every inducement
that fear and generosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> could invent, and that was in the power
of these Mexicans to control, was, however, presented and urged in
favor of our taking up a residence among them. But we had no certainty
that our small number, though of the race most their dread, would be
sufficient to warrant us in the successful cultivation of the rich and
improved soil that was proffered us. Nothing but a constant guard of
the most vigilant kind could promise any safety to fields of grain, or
herds of cattle.</p>

<p>We next, and at about eighty miles from Santa Cruz, came to Tukjon,
another larger town than Santa Cruz, and more pleasantly, as well as
more securely situated. Here again the same propositions were renewed
as had been plied so vehemently at the last stopping-place. Such were
the advantages that our hosts held out for the raising of a crop of
grain, and fattening our cattle, that some of our party immediately
resolved upon at least one year&#8217;s stay. The whole train halted
here one month. During that time, those of our party who could not
be prevailed upon to proceed, had arrangements made and operations
commenced for a year of agricultural and farming employment.</p>

<p>At the end of one month the family of Wilders, Kellys, and
ourselves, started. We urged on amid multiplying difficulties for
several days. Our provisions had been but poorly replenished at the
last place, as the whole of their crops had been destroyed<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> by
their one common and relentless foe, during the year. With all their
generosity, it was out of their power to aid us as much as they would
have done. Frequently after this, for several nights, we were waked to
arm ourselves against the approaching Apaches, who hung in front and
rear of our camp for nights and days.</p>

<p>Wearied, heart-sick, and nearly destitute, we arrived at the Pimo
Village, on or about the 16th of February, 1851. Here we found a
settlement of Indians, who were in open hostility to the Apaches, and
by whose skill and disciplined strength they were kept from pushing
their depredations further in that direction. But so long had open and
active hostilities been kept up, that they were short of provisions
and in nearly a destitute situation. They had been wont to turn their
attention and energies considerably to farming, but during the last two
years, their habits in this respect had been greatly interfered with.
We found the ninety miles that divides Tukjon from Pimole to be the
most dismal, desolate, and unfruitful of all the regions over which our
way had led us as yet. We could find nothing that could, to a sound
judgment, furnish matter of contention, such as had been raging between
the rival claimants of its blighted peaks and crags.</p>

<p>Poor and desolate as were the war-hunted Pimoles, and unpromising
as seemed every project surveyed by our anxious eyes for relief,
and a supply of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> almost drained stores of provisions, yet
it was soon apparent to our family, that if we would proceed further we
must venture the journey alone. Soon, and after a brief consultation,
a full resolution was reached by the Wilders and Kellys to remain,
and stake their existence upon traffic with the Pimoles, or upon a
sufficient tarrying to produce for themselves; until from government or
friends, they might be supplied with sufficient to reach Fort Yuma.</p>

<p>To Mr. Oatman this resolution brought a trial of a darker hue
than any that had cast its shadows upon him as yet. He believed that
starvation, or the hand of the treacherous savage, would soon bring
them to an awful fate if they tarried; and with much reluctance he
resolved to proceed, with no attendants or companions save his exposed
and depressed family.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader should here
be apprised that, as the entire narrative that follows has an almost
exclusive reference to those members of the family who alone survive
to tell this sad tale of their sufferings and privations, it has been
thought the most appropriate that it be given in the first person.</p>

<p>Lorenzo D. Oatman has given to the author the following facts,
reaching on to the moment when he was made senseless, and in that
condition left by the Apache murderers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were left to the severe alternative of starting with a
meagre supply, which any considerable delay<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> would exhaust ere we
could reach a place of re-supply, or to stay among the apparently
friendly Indians, who also were but poorly supplied at best to
furnish us; and of whose <em>real</em> intentions it was impossible to
form any reliable conclusion. The statement that I have since seen
in the &#8216;Ladies&#8217; Repository,&#8217; made by a traveling
correspondent who was at Pimole village at the time of writing,
concerning the needlessness and absence of all plausible reason for the
course resolved upon by my father, is incorrect. There were reasons
for the tarrying of the Wilders and Kellys that had no pertinence when
considered in connection with the peculiarities of the condition of my
father&#8217;s family. The judgment of those who remained, approved of
the course elected by my father.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the many circumstances that conspired to spread a
gloom over the way that was before us, was the jaded condition of
our team, which by this time consisted of two yoke of cows and one
yoke of oxen. My parents were in distress and perplexity for some
time to determine the true course dictated by prudence, and their
responsibility in the premises. One hundred and ninety miles of
desert and mountain, each alike barren and verdureless, save now and
then a diminutive gorge (water-coursed and grass-fringed, that miles
apart led down from the high mountain ranges across the dreary road)
stretched out between us and the next settlement or habitation of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> man.
We felt, deeply felt, the hazardous character of our undertaking; and
for a time lingered in painful suspense over the proposed adventure.
We felt and feared that a road stretching to such a distance, through
an uninhabited and wild region, might be infested with marauding bands
of the Indians who were known to roam over the mountains that were
piled up to the north of us; who, though they might be persuaded or
intimidated to spare us the fate of falling by their savage hands, yet
might plunder us of all we had as means for life&#8217;s subsistence.
While in this dreadful suspense, one Dr. Lecount, attended by a Mexican
guide, came into the Pimole village. He was on his return from a tour
that had been pushed westward, almost to the Pacific Ocean. As soon
as we learned of his presence among us, father sought and obtained an
interview with him. And it was upon information gained from him, that
the decision to proceed was finally made.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had passed the whole distance to Fort Yuma, and returned,
all within a few months, unharmed; and stated that he had not witnessed
indications of even the neighborhood of Indians. Accordingly on the
11th of March, finding provisions becoming scarce among the Pimoles,
and our own rapidly wasting, unattended, in a country and upon a
road where the residence, or even the trace of one of our own nation
would be sought in vain, save that of the hurrying traveler who was
upon some official mission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64"
id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> or, as in the case of Dr. Lecount, some
scientific pursuit requiring dispatch, we resumed our travel. Our
teams were reduced; we were disappointed in being abandoned by our
fellow-travelers, and wearied, almost to exhaustion, by the long
and fatiguing march that had conducted us to this point. We were
lengthening out a toilsome journey for an object and destination quite
foreign to the one that had pushed us upon the wild scheme at first.
And this solitary commencement on our travel upon a devious way, dismal
as it was in every aspect, seemed the only alternative that gave
any promise of an extrication from the dark and frowning perils and
sufferings that were every day threatening about us, and with every
step of advance into the increasing wildness pressing more and more
heavily upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let the imagination of the reader awake and dwell upon the
probable feelings of those fond parents at this trying juncture of
circumstances; and when it shall have drawn upon the resources that
familiarity with the heart&#8217;s deepest anguish may furnish, it will
fail to paint them with any of that poignant accuracy that will bring
him into stern sympathy with their condition.</p>

<p>Attended by a family, a family which, in the event of their being
overtaken by any of the catastrophes that reason and prudence bade
them beware of on the route, must be helpless; if they did not, even
by their presence and peculiar exposure, give point and power<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> to the
sense and presence of danger; a family entirely dependent upon them
for that daily bread of which they were liable to be left destitute
at any moment; far from human abodes, and with the possibility that,
beyond the reach of relief, they might be set upon by the grim, ghastly
demon of famine, or be made the victims of the blood-thirstiness
and slow tortures of those human devils who, with savage ferocity,
lurk for prey, when least their presence is anticipated; the faint
prospect at best there was for accomplishing all that must be performed
ere they could count upon safety; these, all these, and a thousand
kindred considerations, crowded upon those lonely hours of travel, and
furnished attendant reflections that burned through the whole being
of these parents with the intensity of desperation. O! how many noble
hearts have been turned out upon these dismal, death-marked by-ways,
that have as yet formed the only land connection between the Atlantic
and Pacific slopes, to bleed, and moan, and sigh, for weeks, and even
months, suspended in painful uncertainty, between life and death at
every moment. Apprehensions for their own safety, or the safety of
dependent ones, like ghosts infernal, haunting them at every step.
Fear, fear worse than death, if possible, lest sickness, famine, or
the sudden onslaught of merciless savages, that infest the mountain
fastnesses, and prowl and skulk through the innumerable hiding-places
furnished by the wide sage-fields and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> chaparral, might intercept
a journey, the first stages of which glowed with the glitter and charm
of novelty, and beamed with the light of hope, but was now persisted
in, through unforeseen and deepening gloom, as a last and severe
alternative of self-preservation, oppressed their hearts.</p>

<p>Monuments! monuments, blood-written, of these uncounted miseries,
that will survive the longest lived of those most recently escaped, are
inscribed upon the bleached and bleaching bones of our common humanity
and nationality; are written upon the rude graves of our countrymen and
kin, that strew these highways of death; written upon the moldering
timbers of decaying vehicles of transport; written in blood that now
beats and pulsates in the veins of solitary and scathed survivors,
as well as in the stain of kindred blood that still preserves its
tale-telling, unbleached hue, upon scattered grass-plots, and Sahara
sand mounds; written upon favored retreats, sought at the close of a
dusty day&#8217;s toil for nourishment, but suddenly turned into one of
the unattended, unchronicled deathbeds, already and before frequenting
these highways of carnage and wrecks; written, ah! too sadly, deeply
<em>engraven</em> upon the tablet of memories that keep alive the scenes
of butcheries and captive-making that have rent and mangled whole
households, and are now preserved to embitter the whole gloom-clad
afterpart of the miraculously preserved survivors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67"
id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>If there be an instance of one family having experienced trials
that with peculiar pungency may suggest a train of reflection like the
above, that family is the one presented to the reader&#8217;s notice in
these pages. Seven of them have fallen under the extreme of the dark
picture; two only live to tell herein the tale of their own narrow
escape, and the agonies which marked the process by which it came.</p>

<p>&#8220;For six days,&#8221; says one of these, &#8220;our course was
due southwest, at a slow and patience-trying rate. We were pressing
through many difficulties, with which our minds were so occupied that
they could neither gather nor retain any distinct impression of the
country over which this first week of our solitary travel bore us.
While thus, on the seventh day from Pimole, we were struggling and
battling with the tide of opposition that, with the increasing force of
multiplying embarrassments and drawbacks, was setting in against us,
our teams failing and sometimes in the most difficult and dangerous
places utterly refusing to proceed, we were overtaken by Dr. Lecount,
who with his Mexican guide was on his way back to Fort Yuma. The doctor
saw our condition, and his large, generous heart poured upon us a flood
of sympathy, which, with the words of good cheer he addressed us, was
the only relief it was in his power to administer. Father sent by him,
and at his own suggestion, to the fort for immediate assistance. This
message the doctor promised should be conveyed to the fort, (we<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> were
about ninety miles distant from it at the time,) with all possible
dispatch, also kindly assuring us that all within his power should
be done to procure us help <em>at once</em>. We were all transiently elated
with the prospect thus suddenly opening upon us of a relief from this
source, and especially as we were confident that Dr. Lecount would
be prompted to every office and work in our behalf, that he might
command at the fort, where he was well and favorably known. But soon
a dark cloud threw its shadow upon all these hopes, and again our
wonted troubles rolled upon us with an augmented force. Our minds
became anxious, and our limbs were jaded. The roads had been made bad,
at places almost impassable, by recent rains, and for the first time
the strength and courage of my parents gave signs of exhaustion. It
seemed, and indeed was thus spoken of among us, that the dark wing of
some terrible calamity was spread over us, and casting the shadows of
evil ominously and thickly upon our path. The only method by which we
could make the ascent of the frequent high hills that hedged our way,
was by unloading the wagon and carrying the contents piece by piece to
the top; and even then we were often compelled to aid a team of four
cows and two oxen to lift the empty wagon. It was well for us, perhaps,
that there was not added to the burden of these long and weary hours, a
knowledge of the mishap that had befallen the messenger gone on<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> before.
About sunset of the day after Dr. Lecount left us, he camped about
thirty miles ahead of us, turned his horses into a small valley hemmed
in by high mountains, and with his guide slept until about daybreak.
Just as the day was breaking and preparations were being made to gather
up for a ride to the fort that day, twelve Indians suddenly emerged
from behind a bluff hill near by and entered the camp. Dr. Lecount,
taken by surprise by the presence of these unexpected visitants, seized
his arms, and with his guide kept a close eye upon their movements,
which he soon discovered wore a very suspicious appearance. One of the
Indians would draw the doctor into a conversation, which they held in
the Mexican tongue; during which others of the band would with an air
of carelessness edge about, encircling the doctor and his guide, until
in a few moments, despite their friendly professions, their treacherous
intentions were plainly read. At the suggestion of his bold, intrepid,
and experienced guide, they both sprang to one side, the guide
presenting to the Indians his knife, and the doctor his pistol. The
Indians then put on the attitude of fight, but feared to strike. They
still continued their efforts to beguile the doctor into carelessness,
by introducing questions and topics of conversation, but they could not
manage to cover with this thin gauze the murder of their hearts. Soon
the avenging ferocity of the Mexican began to burn, he violently<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> sprang
into the air, rushed toward them brandishing his knife, and beckoning
to the doctor to come on; he was about in the act of plunging his knife
into the leader of the band, but was restrained by the coolness and
prudence of Doctor Lecount. Manuel (the guide) was perfectly enraged at
their insolence, and would again and again spring, tiger-like toward
them, crying at the top of his voice, &#8220;<em>terrily, terrily!</em>&#8221;
The Indians soon made off. On going into the valley for their animals
they soon found that the twelve Indians had enacted the above scene in
the camp, merely as a ruse to engage their attention, while another
party of the same rascal band were driving their mules and horse
beyond their reach. They found evidences that this had been done
within the last hour. The doctor returned to camp, packed his saddle
and packages in a convenient, secluded place near by, and gave orders
to his guide to proceed immediately to the fort, himself resolving to
await his return. Soon after Manuel had left, however, he bethought
him of the Oatman family, of their imminent peril, and of the pledge
he had put himself under to them, to secure them the earliest possible
assistance; and he now had become painfully apprised of reasons for the
most prompt and punctual fulfillment of that pledge. He immediately
prepared, and at a short distance toward us posted upon a tree near
the road a card, warning us of the nearness of the Apaches, and
relating therein in brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> what had befallen himself at their hands;
reassuring us also of his determined diligence to secure us protection,
and declaring his purpose, contrary to a resolution he had formed on
dismissing his guide, to proceed immediately to the fort, there in
person to plead our case and necessities. This card we missed, though
it was afterward found by those whom we had left at Pimole Village.
What &#8220;might have been,&#8221; could our eyes have fallen upon
that small piece of paper, though it is now useless to conjecture,
cannot but recur to the mind. It might have preserved fond parents,
endeared brothers and sisters, to gladden and cheer a now embittered
and bereft existence. But the card, and the saddle and packages of the
doctor, we saw not until weeks after, as the sequel will show, though
we spent a night at the same camp where the scenes had been enacted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toward evening of the eighteenth day of March, we reached the
Gila River, at a point over eighty miles from Pimole, and about the
same distance from Fort Yuma.</p>

<p>&#8220;We descended to the ford from a high, bluff hill, and found
it leading across at a point where the river armed, leaving a small
island sand-bar in the middle of the stream. We frequently found places
on our road upon which the sun shines not, and for hours together the
road led through a region as wild and rough as the imagination ever
painted any portion of our earth. It was impossible, save for<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> a few
steps at a time, to see at a distance in any direction; and although
we were yet inspirited at seasons with the report of Dr. Lecount, upon
which we had started, yet we could not blind our eyes or senses to the
possibilities that might lurk unseen and near, and to the advantages
over us that the nature of the country about us would furnish the
evil-designing foe of the white race, whose habitations we knew were
locked up somewhere within these huge, irregular mountain ranges. Much
less could we be indifferent to the probable inability of our teams
to bear us over the distance still separating us from the place and
stay of our hope. We attempted to cross the Gila about sunset; the
stream was rapid, and swollen to an unusual width and depth. After
struggling with danger and every possible hinderance until long after
dark, we reached the sand island in the middle of the stream. Here our
teams mired, our wagon dragged heavily, and we found it impossible to
proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;After reaching the center and driest portion of the island,
with the wagon mired in the rear of us, we proceeded to detach the
teams, and as best, we could made preparations to spend the night.
Well do I remember the forlorn countenance and dejected and jaded
appearance of my father as he started to wade the lesser branch of
the river ahead of us to gather material for a fire. At a late hour
of that cold, clear, wind-swept night, a camp-fire was struck,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> and
our shivering group encircled it to await the preparation of our
stinted allowance. At times the wind, which was blowing furiously most
of the night, would lift the slight surges of the Gila quite to our
camp-fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let the mind of the reader pause and ponder upon the situation of
that forlorn family at this time. Still unattended and unbefriended;
without a white person or his habitation within the wide range of
nearly a hundred miles; the Gila, a branch of which separated them from
either shore, keeping up a ceaseless, mournful murmuring through the
entire night; the wild wind, as it swept unheeding by, sighing among
the distant trees and rolling along the forest of mountain peaks, kept
up a perpetual moan solemn as a funeral dirge. The imagination can but
faintly picture the feelings of those fond parents upon whom hung such
a fearful responsibility as was presented to their minds and thoughts
by the gathering of this little loved family group about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A large part of the night was spent by the children (for
sleep we could not) in conversation upon our trying situation; the
dangers, though unseen, that might be impending over our heads; of the
past, the present, and the cloud-wrapt future; of the perils of our
undertaking, which were but little realized under the light of novelty
and hope that inspired our first setting out&mdash;an undertaking
well-intentioned but now shaping itself so rudely and unseemly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74"
id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We were compelled frequently to shift our position, as the
fickle wind would change the point at which the light surges of the
Gila would attack our camp-fire, in the center of that little island
of about two hundred square feet, upon which we had of necessity
halted for the night. While our parents were in conversation a little
apart, which, too, they were conducting in a subdued tone for purposes
of concealment, the curiosity of the elder children, restless and
inquisitive, was employed in guessing at the probable import of
their councils. We talked, with the artlessness and eagerness of our
unrealizing age, of the dangers possibly near us, of the advantage that
our situation gave to the savages, who were our only dread; and each
in his or her turn would speak, as we shiveringly gathered around that
little, threatened, sickly camp-fire, of his or her intentions in case
of the appearance of the foe. Each had to give a map of the course to
be pursued if the cruel Apaches should set upon us, and no two agreed;
one saying, &#8216;I shall run;&#8217; another, &#8216;I will fight and
die fighting;&#8217; and still another, &#8216;I will take the gun or a
club and keep them off;&#8217; and last, Miss Olive says, &#8216;Well,
there is one thing; I shall not be taken by these miserable brutes. I
will fight as long as I can, and if I see that I am about to be taken,
I will kill myself. I do not care to die, but it would be worse than
death to me to be taken a captive among them<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>How apprehensive, how timid, how frail a thing is the human mind,
especially when yet untutored, and uninured to the severe allotments
that are in this state incident to lengthened years. Experience alone
can test the wisdom of the resolutions with which we arm ourselves
for anticipated trials, or our ability to carry them out. How little
it knows of its power or skill to triumph in the hour of sudden and
trying emergency, only as the reality itself shall test and call it
forth. Olive lives to-day to dictate a narrative of five gloomy years
of captivity, that followed upon a totally different issue of an event
that during that night, as a possibility merely, was the matter of vows
and resolutions, but which in its reality mocked and taunted the plans
and purposes that had been formed for its control.</p>

<p>&#8220;The longed-for twilight at length sent its earliest stray
beams along the distant peaks, stole in upon our sand-bar camp, and
gradually lifted the darkness from our dreary situation. As the curtain
of that burdensome night departed, it seemed to bear with it those
deep and awful shades that had rested upon our minds during its stay,
and which we now began to feel had taken their gloomiest hue from the
literal darkness and solitude that has a strange power to nurse a
morbid apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before us, and separating the shore from us, was a part of
the river yet to be forded. At an early hour the teams were brought
from the valley-neck of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76"
id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> land, where they had found scant pasturage
for the night, and attached to the wagon. We soon made the opposite
bank. Before us was quite a steep declivity of some two hundred feet,
by the way of the road. We had proceeded but a short distance when our
galled and disarranged teams refused to go. We were again compelled to
unload, and with our own hands and strength to bear the last parcel
to the top of the hill. After this we found it next to impossible to
compel the teams to drag the empty wagon to the summit.</p>

<p>&#8220;After reaching the other bank we camped, and remained through
the heat of the day intending to travel the next night by moonlight.
About two hours and a half before sunset we started, and just before
the sun sank behind the western hills we had made the ascent of the
hill and about one mile advance. Here we halted to reload the remainder
of our baggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;The entire ascent was not indeed made until we reached this
point, and to it some of our baggage had been conveyed by hand. I
now plainly saw a sad, foreboding change in my father&#8217;s manner
and feelings. Hitherto, amid the most fatiguing labor and giant
difficulties, he had seemed generally armed for the occasion with a
hopeful countenance and cheerful spirit and manner, the very sight of
which had a power to dispel our childish fears and spread contentment
and resignation upon our little group.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> While ascending this
hill I saw, too plainly saw, (being familiar, young as I was, with
my father&#8217;s aptness to express, by the tone of his action and
manner, his mental state,) as did my mother also, that a change had
come over him. Disheartening and soul-crushing apprehensions were
written upon his manner, as if preying upon his mind in all the
mercilessness of a conquering despair. There seemed to be a dark
picture hung up before him, upon which the eye of his thought rested
with a monomaniac intensity; and written thereon he seemed to behold
a sad afterpart for himself, as if some terrible event had loomed
suddenly upon the field of his mental vision, and though unprophesied
and unheralded by any palpable notice, yet gradually wrapping its folds
about him, and coming in, as it were, to fill his cup of anguish to the
brim. Surely,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Coming events cast their shadows before them.</p>
<p>Who hath companioned a visit from the horn or ivory gate?</p>
<p>Who hath propounded the law that renders calamities gregarious?</p>
<p>Pressing down with yet more woe the heavy laden mourner;</p>
<p>Yea, a palpable notice warneth of an instant danger;</p>
<p>For the soul hath its feelers, cobwebs upon the wings of the wind,</p>
<p>That catch events, in their approach, with sure and sad presentiment.&#8217;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Whether my father had read that notice left for our
warning by Dr. Lecount, and had from prudence concealed it, with
the impression it may have made upon his own mind, from us, to
prevent the torment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78"
id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> of fear it would have enkindled; or
whether a camp-fire might have been discerned by him in the distance
the night before, warning of the nearness of the savage Apaches; or
whether by spirit law or the appointment of Providence the gloom of
his waiting doom had been sent on before to set his mind in readiness
for the breaking storm, are questions that have been indulged and
involuntarily urged by his fond, bereaved children; but no answer
to which has broke upon their ear from mountain, from dale, or from
spirit-land. For one hour the night before my father had wept bitterly,
while in the wagon thinking himself concealed from his family, but
of which I was ignorant until it was told me by my eldest sister
during the day. My mother was calm, cool, and collected; patient to
endure, and diligent to do, that she might administer to the comfort
of the rest of us. Of the real throbbings of the affectionate and
indulgent heart of that beloved mother, her children must ever remain
ignorant. But of her noble bearing under these trying circumstances
angels might speak; and her children, who survive to cherish her
name with an ardent, though sorrowing affection, may be pardoned for
not keeping silence. True to the instincts that had ever governed
her in all trying situations, and true to the dictates of a noble
and courageous heart, she wisely attributed these shadows (the wing
of which flitted over her own sky as well) to the harassings and
exhaustion of the hour; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> called them the accustomed creations of
an over-tasked mind, and then, with cheerful heart and ready hand,
plied herself to all and any labors that might hie us upon our way. At
one time, during the severest part of the toil and efforts of that day
to make the summit of that hill, my father suddenly sank down upon a
stone near the wagon, and exclaimed, &#8216;Mother, mother, in the name
of God, I know that something dreadful is about to happen!&#8217; In
reply, our dear mother had no expressions but those of calm, patient
trust, and a vigorous, resolute purpose.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;O, Mother? bless&#8217;d sharer of our joys and woes,</p>
<p>E&#8217;en in the darkest hours of earthly ill,</p>
<p>Untarnish&#8217;d yet thy fond affection glow&#8217;d,</p>
<p>When sorrow rent the heart, when feverish pain</p>

<p>To soothe the soul, to cool the burning brain,</p>
<p>O who so welcome and so prompt as thou?&#8217;</p>
  </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We found ourselves now upon the summit, which proved to be
the east edge of a long table-land, stretching upon a level, a long
distance westward, and lying between two deep gorges, one on the right,
the other on the left; the former coursed by the Gila River. We had
hastily taken our refreshment, consisting of a few parcels of dry
bread, and some bean-soup, preparatory to a night&#8217;s travel. This
purpose of night travel had been made out of mercy to our famished
teams, so weak that it was with difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> they could be driven during
the extreme sultry heat of the day. Besides this, the moon was nearly
in full, giving us light nearly the entire night; the nights were
cool, and better for travel to man and beast, and the shortness of
our provisions made it imperative that we should make the most of our
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up, upon an elevated, narrow table-land, formed principally of lime
rock, look now at this family; the scattered rough stones about them
forming their seats, upon which they sit them down in haste to receive
the frugal meal to strengthen them for the night&#8217;s travel.
From two years old and upward, that group of children, unconscious
of danger, but dreading the lone, long hours of the night&#8217;s
journey before them. To the south of them, a wild, uninhabited, and
uninhabitable region, made up of a succession of table-lands, varying
in size and in height, with rough, verdureless sides, and separated
by deep gorges and dark ca&ntilde;ons, without any vegetation save
an occasional scrub-tree standing out from the general sterility.
Around them, not a green spot to charm, to cheer, to enliven the
tame, tasteless desolation and barrenness; at the foot of the bold
elevation, that gives them a wider view than was granted while winding
the difficult defiles of the crooked road left behind them, murmurs
on the ceaseless Gila, upon which they gaze, over a bold precipice at
the right. To the east and north, mountain ranges rising skyward<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> until
they seem to lean against the firmament. But within all the extended
field swept by their curious, anxious vision, no smoking chimney of
a friendly habitation appears to temper the sense of loneliness, or
apprise them of the accessibleness of friendly sympathy or aid. Before
them, a dusty, stony road points to the scene of anticipated hardships,
and the land of their destination. The sun had scarcely concealed
his burning face behind the western hills, ere the full-orbed moon
peers from the craggy mountain chain in the rear, as if to mock at
the sun weltering in his fading gore, and proffering the reign of her
chastened, mellow light for the whole dreaded night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though the sun had hid its glittering, dazzling face from
us behind a tall peak in the distance, yet its rays lingered upon the
summits that stretched away between us and the moon, and daylight was
full upon us. Our hasty meal had been served. My father, sad, and
seemingly spell-bound with his own struggling emotions, was a little on
one side, as if oblivious of all immediately about him, and was about
in the act of lifting some of the baggage to the wagon, that had as yet
remained unloaded since the ascent of the hill, when, casting my eyes
down the hill by the way we had come, I saw several Indians slowly and
leisurely approaching us in the road. I was greatly alarmed, and for
a moment dared not to speak. At the time, my<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> father&#8217;s back was
turned. I spoke to him, at the same time pointing to the Indians.
What I saw in my father&#8217;s countenance excited in me a great
fear, and took a deeper hold upon my feelings of the danger we were
in, than the sight of the Indians. They were now approaching near us.
The blood rushed to my father&#8217;s face. For a moment his face
would burn and flash as it crimsoned with the tide from within; then
a death-like paleness would spread over his countenance, as if his
whole frame was suddenly stiffened with horror. I saw too plainly the
effort that it cost him to attempt a concealment of his emotions. He
succeeded, however, in controlling the jerking of his muscles and his
mental agitations, so as to tell us, in mild and composed accents,
&#8216;not to fear; the Indians would not harm us.&#8217; He had
always been led to believe that the Indians could be so treated as to
avoid difficulty with them. He had been among them much in the Western
states, and so often tried his theory of leniency with success that
he often censured the whites for their severity toward them; and was
disposed to attribute injury received from them to the unwise and cruel
treatment of them by the whites. It had long been his pride and boast
that he could manage the Indians so that it would do to trust them.
Often had he thrown himself wholly in their power, while traveling
and doing business in Iowa, and that, too, in times of excitement
and hostility, relying upon his coolness, self-possession, and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> urbanity
toward them to tame and disarm their ferocity. As yet, his theory
had worked no injury to himself, though often practiced against the
remonstrances of friends. But what might serve for the treatment of
the Iowa Indians, might need modification for these fierce Apaches.
Besides, his wonted coolness and fearlessness seemed, as the Indians
approached, to have forsaken him; and I have never been able to account
for the conduct of my father at this time, only by reducing to reality
the seemings of the past few days or hours, to wit, that a dark doom
had been written out or read to him before.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the Indians approached, he became collected, and kindly
motioned them to sit down; spoke to them in Spanish, to which they
replied. They immediately sat down upon the stones about us, and still
conversing with father in Spanish, made the most vehement professions
of friendship. They asked for tobacco and a pipe, that they might smoke
in token of their sincerity and of their friendly feelings toward
us. This my father immediately prepared, took a whiff himself, then
passed it around, even to the last. But amid all this, the appearance
and conduct of father was strange. The discerning and interested eye
of his agitated family could too plainly discover the uncontrollable,
unspoken mental convulsions that would steal the march upon the forced
appearances of composure that his better judgment, as well as yearnings
for his family, dictated for the occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> His movements were
a reflecting glass, in which we could as plainly read some dire
catastrophe was breeding for us, as well as in the flashes and glances
that flew from face to face of our savage-looking visitants.</p>

<p>&#8220;After smoking, these Indians asked for something to eat.
Father told them of our destitute condition, and that he could not feed
them without robbing his family; that unless we could soon reach a
place of new supplies we must suffer. To all this they seemed to yield
only a reluctant hearing. They became earnest and rather imperative,
and every plea that we made to them of our distress, but increased
their wild and furious clamors. Father reluctantly took some bread
from the wagon and gave it to them, saying that it was robbery, and
perhaps starvation to his family. As soon as this was devoured they
asked for more, meanwhile surveying us narrowly, and prying and looking
into every part of the wagon. They were told that we could spare them
no more. They immediately packed themselves into a secret council
a little on one side, which they conducted in the Apache language,
wholly unintelligible to us. We were totally in the dark as to their
designs, save that their appearance and actions wore the threatening of
some hellish deed. We were now about ready to start. Father had again
returned to complete the reloading of the remainder of the articles;
mother was in the wagon arranging them;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> Olive, with my older
sister, was standing upon the opposite side of the wagon; Mary Ann, a
little girl about seven years old, sat upon a stone holding to a rope
attached to the horns of the foremost team; the rest of the children
were on the opposite side of the wagon from the Indians. My eyes were
turned away from the Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though each of the family was engaged in repairing the wagon,
none were without manifestations of fear. For some time every movement
of the Indians was closely watched by us. I well remember, however,
that after a few moments my own fears were partially quieted, and from
their appearance I judged it was so with the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a subdued tone frequent expressions were made concerning
the Indians, and their possible intentions; but we were guarded and
cautious, lest they might understand our real dread and be emboldened
to violence. Several minutes did they thus remain a few feet from us,
occasionally turning an eye upon us, and constantly keeping up a low
earnest babbling among themselves. At times they gazed eagerly in
various directions, especially down the road by which we had come, as
if struggling to discern the approach of some object or person either
dreaded or expected by them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suddenly, as a clap of thunder from a clear sky, a deafening
yell broke upon us, the Indians jumping into the air, and uttering
the most frightful shrieks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86"
id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> and at the same time springing toward us
flourishing their war-clubs, which had hitherto been concealed under
their wolf-skins. I was struck upon the top and back of my head,
came to my knees, when with another blow, I was struck blind and
senseless.&#8221; One of their number seized and jerked Olive one side,
ere they had dealt the first blow.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;As soon,&#8221; continues Olive, &#8220;as they had taken
me one side, and while one of the Indians was leading me off, I saw
them strike Lorenzo, and almost at the same instant my father also.
I was so bewildered and taken by surprise by the suddenness of their
movements, and their deafening yells, that it was some little time
before I could realize the horrors of my situation. When I turned
around, opened my eyes, and collected my thoughts, I saw my father, my
own dear father! struggling, bleeding, and moaning in the most pitiful
manner. Lorenzo was lying with his face in the dust, the top of his
head covered with blood, and his ears and mouth bleeding profusely. I
looked around and saw my poor mother, with her youngest child clasped
in her arms, and both of them still, as if the work of death had
already been completed; a little distance on the opposite side of the
wagon, stood little Mary Ann, with her face covered with her hands,
sobbing aloud, and a huge-looking Indian standing over her; the rest
were motionless, save a younger brother and my father, all upon the
ground dead or dying. At this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87"
id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> sight a thrill of icy coldness passed over
me; I thought I had been struck; my thoughts began to reel and became
irregular and confused; I fainted and sank to the earth, and for a
while, I know not how long, I was insensible.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I recovered my thoughts I could hardly realize where I
was, though I remembered to have considered myself as having also been
struck to the earth, and thought I was probably dying. I knew that
all, or nearly all of the family had been murdered; thus bewildered,
confused, half conscious and half insensible, I remained a short
time, I know not how long, when suddenly I seemed awakened to the
dreadful realities around me. My little sister was standing by my side,
sobbing and crying, saying: &#8216;Mother, O mother! Olive, mother
and father are killed, with all our poor brothers and sisters.&#8217;
I could no longer look upon the scene. Occasionally a low, piteous
moan would come from some one of the family as in a dying state. I
distinguished the groans of my poor mother, and sprang wildly toward
her, but was held back by the merciless savage holding me in his
cruel grasp, and lifting a club over my head, threatening me in the
most taunting, barbarous manner. I longed to have him put an end to
my life. &#8216;O,&#8217; thought I, &#8216;must I know that my poor
parents have been killed by these savages and I remain alive!&#8217;
I asked them to kill me, pleaded with them to take my life, but
all my pleas and prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88"
id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> only excited to laughter and taunts the
two wretches to whose charge we had been committed.</p>

<p>&#8220;After these cruel brutes had consummated their work of
slaughter, which they did in a few moments, they then commenced to
plunder our wagon, and the persons of the family whom they had killed.
They broke open the boxes with stones and clubs, plundering them of
such of their contents as they could make serviceable to themselves.
They took off the wagon wheels, or a part of them, tore the wagon
covering off from its frame, unyoked the teams and detached them from
the wagons, and commenced to pack the little food, with many articles
of their plunder, as if preparatory to start on a long journey.
Coming to a feather bed, they seized it, tore it open, scattering
its contents to the winds, manifesting meanwhile much wonder and
surprise, as if in doubt what certain articles of furniture, and
conveniences for the journey we had with us, could be intended for.
Such of these as they selected, with the little food we had with us
that they could conveniently pack, they tied up in bundles, and started
down the hill by the way they had come, driving us on before them.
We descended the hill, not knowing their intentions concerning us,
but under the expectation that they would probably take our lives by
slow torture. After we had descended the hill and crossed the river,
and traveled about one half of a mile by a dim trail leading through
a dark, rough, and narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89"
id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> defile in the hills, we came to an open
place where there had been an Indian camp before, and halted. The
Indians took off their packs, struck a fire, and began in their own way
to make preparations for a meal. They boiled some of the beans just
from our wagon, mixed some flour with water, and baked it in the ashes.
They offered us some food, but in the most insulting and taunting
manner, continually making merry over every indication of grief in us,
and with which our hearts were ready to break. We could not eat. After
the meal, and about an hour&#8217;s rest, they began to repack and make
preparations to proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter we
ask the reader to trace with us the narrow and miraculous escape of
Lorenzo Oatman, after being left for dead by the Apaches. He was the
first to receive the death-dealing blow of the perpetrators of that
horrid deed by which most of the family were taken from him. The last
mention we made of him left him, under the effects of that blow,
weltering in his blood. He shall tell his own story of the dreadful
after-part. It has in it a candor, a freedom from the tinselings so
often borrowed from a morbid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"
id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> imagination, and thrown about artificial
romance, that commends it to the reader, especially to the juvenile
reader. It exhibits a presence of mind, courage, and resoluteness
that, as an example, may serve as a light to cheer and inspirit that
boy whose eye is now tracing this record, when he shall find himself
stumbling amid mishaps and pitfalls in the future, and when seasons of
darkness, like the deep, deep midnight, shall close upon his path:</p>

<p>&#8220;I soon must have recovered my consciousness after I had
been struck down, for I heard distinctly the repeated yells of those
fiendish Apaches. And these I heard mingling in the most terrible
confusion with the shrieks and cries of my dear parents, brothers,
and sisters, calling, in the most pitiful, heart-rending tones,
for &#8216;Help, help! In the name of God, cannot any one help
us?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;To this day the loud wail sent up by our dear mother from
that rough death-bed still rings in my ears. I heard the scream,
shrill, and sharp, and long, of these defenseless, unoffending
brothers and sisters, distinguishing the younger from the older
as well as I could have done by their natural voice; and these
constantly blending with the brutal, coarse laugh, and the wild, raving
whooping of their murderers. Well do I remember coming to myself,
with sensations as of waking from a long sleep, but which soon gave
place to the dreadful reality; at which time all would be silent
for a moment, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92"
id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> silence broken by the low, subdued,
but unintelligible gibberings of the Indians, intermingled with an
occasional low, faint moan from some one of the family, as if in the
last agonies of death. I could not move. I thought of trying to get
up, but found I could not command a muscle or a nerve. I heard their
preparations for leaving, and distinctly remember to have thought, at
the time, that my heart had ceased to beat, and that I was about giving
my last breath. I heard the sighs and moans of my sisters, heard them
speak, knew the voice of Olive, but could not tell whether one or more
was preserved with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;While lying in this state, two of the wretches came up to
me, rolling me over with their feet; they examined and rifled my
pockets, took off my shoes and hat in a hurried manner; then laid hold
of my feet and roughly dragged me a short distance, and then seemed
to leave me for dead. During all this, except for a moment at a time,
occasionally, I was perfectly conscious, but could not see. I thought
each moment would be my last. I tried to move again and again, but
was under the belief that life had gone from my body and limbs, and
that a few more breathings would shut up my senses. There seemed a
light spot directly over my head, which was gradually growing smaller,
dwindling to a point. During this time I was conscious of emotions
and thoughts peculiar and singular, aside from their relation<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> to the
horrors about me. At one time (and it seemed hours) I was ranging
through undefined, open space, with paintings and pictures of all
imaginable sizes and shapes hung about me, as if at an immense
distance, and suspended upon walls of ether. At another, strange and
discordant sounds would grate on my ear, so unlike any that my ear ever
caught, that it would be useless endeavoring to give a description of
them. Then these would gradually die away, and there rolled upon my ear
such strains of sweet music as completely ravished all my thoughts,
and I was perfectly happy. And in all this I could not define myself;
I knew not who I was, save that I knew, or supposed I knew, I had come
from some far-off region, only a faint remembrance of which was borne
along with me. But to attempt to depict all of what seemed a strange,
actual experience, and that I now know to have been crowded into a
few hours, would only excite ridicule; though there was something so
fascinating and absorbing to my engaged mind, that I frequently long to
reproduce its unearthly music and sights.</p>

<p>&#8220;After being left by the Indians, the thoughts I had, traces
of which are still in my memory, were of opening my eyes, knowing
perfectly my situation, and thinking still that each breath would be
the last. The full moon was shining upon rock, and hill, and shrub
about me; a more lovely evening indeed I never witnessed. I made an
effort to turn my eye in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94"
id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> search of the place where I supposed my
kindred were cold in death, but could not stir. I felt the blood upon
my mouth, and found it still flowing from my ears and nose. All was
still as the grave. Of the fate of the rest of the family I could not
now determine accurately to myself, but supposed all of them, except
two of the girls, either dead or in my situation. But no sound, no
voice broke the stillness of these few minutes of consciousness; though
upon them there rested the weight of an anguish, the torture and horror
of which pen cannot report. I had a clear knowledge that two or more of
my sisters were taken away alive. Olive I saw them snatch one side ere
they commenced the general slaughter, and I had a faint consciousness
of having heard the voice and sighs of little Mary Ann, after all else
was hushed, save the hurrying to and fro of the Indians, while at their
work of plunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next period, the recollection of which conveys any
distinct impression to my mind at this distance of time, was of again
coming to myself, blind, but thinking my eyes were some way tied
from without. As I rubbed them, and removed the clotted blood from
my eyelids, I gathered strength to open them. The sun, seemingly
from mid-heaven, was looking me full in the face. My head was
beating, and at times reeling under the grasp of a most torturing
pain. I looked at my worn and tattered clothes, and they were
besmeared with blood. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95"
id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> my head and found my scalp torn across
the top. I found I had strength to turn my head, and it surprised me.
I made an effort to get up, and succeeded in rising to my hands and
knees; but then my strength gave way. I saw myself at the foot of a
steep, rugged declivity of rocks, and all about me new. On looking up
upon the rocks I discovered traces of blood marking the way by which
I had reached my present situation from the brow above me. At seasons
there would be a return of partial aberration, and derangement of my
intellect. Against these I sought to brace myself, and study the where
and wherefore of my awful situation. And I wish to record my gratitude
to God for enabling me then and there to collect my thoughts, and
retain my sanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I soon determined in my mind that I had either fallen,
or been hurled down to my present position, from the place where I
was first struck down. At first I concluded I had fallen myself, as
I remembered to have made several efforts to get upon my hands and
knees, but was baffled each time, and that during this I saw myself
near a precipice of rocks, like that brow of the steep near me now,
and that I plainly recognized as the same place, and now sixty feet
or more above me. My consciousness now fully returned, and with it a
painful appreciation of the dreadful tragedies of which my reaching
my present situation had formed a part. I dwelt upon what had<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
overtaken my family-kin, and though I had no certain mode of
determining, yet I concluded it must have been the day before.
Especially would my heart beat toward my fond parents, and dwell upon
their tragical and awful end: I thought of the weary weeks and months
by which they had, at the dint of every possible exertion, borne us to
this point; of the comparatively short distance that would have placed
them beyond anxiety; of the bloody, horrid night that had closed in
upon the troublous day of their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then my thoughts would wander after those dear sisters;
and scarcely could I retain steadiness of mind when I saw them, in
thought, led away I knew not where, to undergo every ill and hardship,
to suffer a thousand deaths at the hands of their heathen captors. I
thought at times (being, I have no doubt, partially delirious) that my
brain was loose, and was keeping up a constant rattling in my head,
and accordingly I pressed my head tightly between my hands, that if
possible I might retain it to gather a resolution for my own escape.
When did so much crowd into so small a space or reflection before?
Friends, that <em>were</em>, now re-presented themselves; but from them, now,
my most earnest implorings for help brought out no hand of relief;
and as I viewed them, surrounded with the pleasures and joys of their
safe home-retreats, the contrast only plunged me deeper in despair.
My old playmates now danced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"
id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> before me again, those with whom I had
caroled away the hours so merrily, and whom I had bidden the laughing,
merry &#8216;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieu</i>,&#8217; only pitying them that they were denied
the elysium of a romantic trip over the Plains. The scenes of sighs,
and tears, and regrets that shrouded the hour of our departure from
kindred and friends, and the weeping appeals they plied so earnestly
to persuade us to desist from an undertaking so freighted with hazard,
now rolled upon me to lacerate and torture these moments of suffocating
gaspings for breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then my own condition would come up, with new views of the
unbroken gloom and despair that walled it in on every side, more
impenetrable to the first ray of hope than the granite bulwarks about
me to the light of the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;A boy of fourteen years, with the mangled remains of my own
parents lying near by, my scalp torn open, my person covered with
blood, alone, friendless, in a wild, mountain, dismal, wilderness
region, exposed to the ravenous beasts, and more, to the ferocity of
more than brutal savages and human-shaped demons! I had no strength to
walk, my spirits crushed, my ambition paralyzed, my body mangled. At
times I despaired, and prayed for death; again I revived, and prayed
God for help. Sometimes, while lying flat on my back, my hands pressing
my torn and blood-clothed head, with the hot sun pouring a full tide
of its unwelcome heat upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98"
id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> me, the very air a hot breath in my face,
I gathered hope that I might yet look upon the white face again, and
that I might live to rehearse the sad present in years to come. And
thus bright flashes of hope and dark gloom-clouds would chase each
other over the sky of my spirit, as if playing with my abandonment and
unmitigated distress. &#8216;And O,&#8217; thought I, &#8216;those
sisters, shall I see them again? must they close their eyes among those
ferocious man-animals?&#8217; I grew sick and faint, dizziness shook
my brain, and my senses fled. I again awoke from the delirium, partly
standing, and making a desperate effort. I felt the thrill of a strong
resolution. &#8216;I will get up,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and <em>will</em>
walk, or if not I will spend the last remnant of my shattered strength
to crawl out of this place.&#8217; I started, and slowly moved toward
the rocks above me. I crept, snail-like, up the rock-stepped side of
the table-land above me. As I drew near the top, having crawled almost
fifty feet, I came in sight of the wagon wreck; then the scenes which
had been wrought about it came back with horror, and nearly unloosed
my hold upon the rocks. I could not look upon those faces and forms,
yet they were within a few feet. The boxes, opened and broken, with
numerous articles, were in sight. I could not trust my feelings to go
further; &#8216;I have misery enough, why should I add fuel to the fire
now already consuming me!&#8217;</p>

  </a>
  <div class="caption">
    <p>RETURNING TO THE PLACE OF MASSACRE.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I turned away, and began to crawl toward the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> east,
round the brow of the hill. After carefully, and with much pain,
struggling all the while against faintness, crawling some distance, I
found myself at the slope leading down to the Ford of the Gila, where
I plainly saw the wagon track we had made, as I supposed, the day
before. The hot sun affected me painfully; its burning rays kindled
my fever, already oppressive, to the boiling point. I felt a giant
determination urging me on. Frequently my weariness and faintness
would bring me to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> several times in a few moments. Then I
would crawl aside, (as I did immediately after crossing the river,)
drag myself under some mountain shrub for escape from the sun, bathe
my fevered head in its friendly shade, and lay me to rest. Faint as I
was from loss of blood, and a raging inward thirst, these, even, were
less afflicting than the meditations and reflections that, unbidden,
would at times steal upon my mind, and lash it to a perfect phrenzy
with agonizing remembrances. The groans of those parents, brothers, and
sisters, haunted me with the grim, fiend-like faces of their murderers,
and the flourishing of their war-clubs; the convulsive throbs of
little Mary Ann would fill my mind with sensations as dreary as if my
traveling had been among the tombs.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;O my God!&#8217; said I, &#8216;am I alive? My poor
father and mother, where are they? And are my sisters alive? or are
they suffering death by burning? Shall I see them again?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus I cogitated, and wept, and sighed, until sleep kindly
shut out the harrowing thoughts. I must have slept for three hours, for
when I woke the sun was behind the western hills. I felt refreshed,
though suffering still from thirst. The road crosses the bend in the
river twice; to avoid this, I made my way over the bluff spur that
turns the road and river to the north. I succeeded after much effort in
sustaining myself upon my feet, with a cane. I walked slowly on, and
gained strength and courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101"
id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> that inspired within some hope of my
escape. I traveled on, only taking rest two or three times during that
evening and whole night. I made in all about fifteen miles by the next
day-break. About eleven o&#8217;clock of the next day I came to a pool
of standing water; I was nearly exhausted when I reached it and lay
me down by it, and drank freely, though the water was warm and muddy.
I had no sooner slaked my thirst than I fell asleep and slept for
some time. I awoke partially delirious, believing that my brain was
trying to jump out of my head, while my hands were pressed to my head
to keep it together, and prevent the exit of my excited brain. When I
had proceeded about ten miles, which I had made by the middle of the
afternoon, I suddenly became faint, my strength failed, and I fell to
the ground. I was at the time upon a high table-land, sandy and barren.
I marveled to know whether I might be dying; I was soon unconscious.
Late in the afternoon I was awakened by some strange noise; I soon
recollected my situation, and the noise, which I now found to be the
barking of dogs or wolves, grew louder and approached nearer. In a
few moments I was surrounded by an army of coyotes and gray wolves.
I was lying in the sun, and was faint from the effects of its heat.
I struggled to get to a small tree near by, but could not. They were
now near enough for me to almost reach them, smelling, snuffing, and
growling as if holding a meeting to see which should be first<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to plunge his sharp teeth in my flesh, and first to gorge his lank
stomach upon my almost bloodless carcass. I was excited with fear,
and immediately sprang to my feet and raised a yell; and as I rose,
struck the one nearest me with my hand. He started back, and the rest
gave way a little. This was the first utterance I had made since the
massacre. These unprincipled gormandizers, on seeing me get up and hurl
a stone at them, ran off a short distance, then turned and faced me;
when they set up one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"
id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> most hideous, doleful howlings that I
ever heard from any source. As it rang out for several minutes upon the
still evening air, and echoed from crag to crag, it sent the most awful
sensations of dread and loneliness thrilling through my whole frame.
&#8216;A fit requiem for the dead,&#8217; thought I. I tried to scatter
them, but they seemed bent upon supplying their stomachs by dividing
my body between them, and thus completing the work left unfinished by
their brothers, the Apaches.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p>ATTACKED BY COYOTES AND WOLVES.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I had come now to think enough of the chance for my life,
to covet it as a boon worth preserving. But I had serious fears when
I saw with what boldness and tenacity they kept upon my track, as I
armed myself with a few rocks and pushed on. The excitement of this
scene fully roused me, and developed physical strength that I had not
been able before to command. The sun had now reached the horizon,
and the first shades of lonely night lay upon the distant gorges
and hill-sides. I kept myself supplied with rocks, occasionally
hurling one at the more insolent of this second tribe of savages.
They seemed determined, however, to force an acquaintance. At times
they would set up one of their wild concerts, and grow furious as
if newly enraged at my escape. Then they would huddle about, fairly
besetting my steps. I was much frightened, but knew of only one course
to take. After becoming weary and faint with hunger and thirst,
some time after dark I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"
id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> feared I should faint, and before
morning be devoured by them. Late in the evening they called a
halt, for a moment stood closely huddled in the road behind me, as
if wondering what blood-clad ghost from some other sphere could
be treading this unfriendly soil. They were soon away, to my glad
surprise; and ere midnight the last echo of their wild yells had died
upon the distant hills to the north. I traveled nearly all night. The
cool night much relieved the pain in my head, but compelled me to
keep up beyond my strength, to prevent suffering from cold. I have
no remembrance of aught from about two to four o&#8217;clock of that
night, until about nine of the next day, save the wild, troublous
dreams that disturbed my sleep. I dreamed of Indians, of bloodshed, of
my sisters, that they were being put to death by slow tortures, that
I was with them, and my turn was coming soon. When I came to myself I
had hardly strength to move a muscle; it was a long time before I could
get up. I concluded I must perish, and meditated seriously the eating
of the flesh from my arm to satisfy my hunger and prevent starvation.
I knew I had not sufficient of life to last to Pimole at this rate,
and concluded it as well to lie there and die, as to put forth more of
painful effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the midst of these musings, too dreadful and full of
horror to be described, I roused and started. About noon I was passing
through a dark ca&ntilde;on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105"
id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> nearly overhung with dripping rocks;
here I slaked my thirst, and was about turning a short corner, when two
red-shirted Pimoles, mounted upon fine American horses, came in sight.
They straightened in their stirrups, drew their bows, with arrows
pointed at me. I raised my hand to my head and beckoned to them, and
speaking in Spanish, begged them not to shoot. Quick as thought, when I
spoke they dropped their bows, and rode up to me. I soon recognized one
of them as an Indian with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106"
id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> I had been acquainted at Pimole
Village. They eyed me closely for a few minutes, when my acquaintance
discovering through my disfigured features who it was, that I was one
of the family that had gone on a little before, dismounted, laid hold
of me, and embraced me with every expression of pity and condolence
that could throb in an American heart. Taking me by the hand they asked
me what could have happened. I told them as well as I could, and of the
fate of the rest of the family. They took me one side under a tree, and
laid me upon their blankets. They then took from their saddle a piece
of their ash-baked bread, and a gourd of water. I ate the piece of
bread, and have often thought of the mercy it was they had no more, for
I might have easily killed myself by eating too much; my cravings were
uncontrollable. They hung up the gourd of water in reach, and charged
me to remain until they might return, promising to carry me to Pimole.
After sleeping a short time I awoke, and became fearful to trust myself
with these Pimoles. They had gone on to the scene of the massacre;
it was near night; I adjusted their blankets and laid them one side,
and commenced the night&#8217;s travel refreshed, and not a little
cheered. But I soon found my body racked with more pain, and oppressed
with more weariness than ever. I kept up all night, most of the time
traveling. It was the loneliest, most horror-struck night of my life.
Glad was I to mark the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107"
id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> streaks of the fourth morning. Never
did twilight shine so bright, or seem empowered to chase so much of
darkness away.</p>

<div class="figcenter inline" style="width: 266px;">

  </a>
  <div class="caption">
    <p>LORENZO RESCUED BY FRIENDLY INDIANS.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Cheered for a few moments, I hastened my steps, staggering
as I went; I found that I was compelled to rest oftener than usual,
I plainly saw I could not hold out much longer. My head was becoming
inflamed within and without, and in places on my scalp was putrid.
About mid-forenoon, after frequent attempts to proceed, I crawled under
a shrub and was soon asleep, I slept two or three hours undisturbed.
&#8216;O my God!&#8217; were the words with which I woke, &#8216;could
I get something to eat, and some one to dress my wounds, I might yet
live.&#8217; I had now a desire to sleep continually. I resisted this
with all the power I had. While thus musing I cast my eyes down upon a
long winding valley through which the road wandered, and plainly saw
moving objects; I was sure they were Indians, and at the thought my
heart sank within me. I meditated killing myself. For one hour I kept
my aching eyes upon the strange appearance, when, all at once, as they
rose upon a slight hill, I plainly recognized two white covered wagons.
O what a moment was that. Hope, joy, confidence, now for the first
time seemed to mount my soul, and hold glad empire over all my pains,
doubts, and fears. In the excitement I lost my consciousness, and waked
not until disturbed by some noise near me. I opened my eyes, and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> two
covered wagons were halting close to me, and Robert was approaching
me. I knew him, but my own appearance was so haggard and unnatural,
it was some time before he detected who that &#8216;strange-looking
boy, covered with blood, hatless and shoeless, could be, his visage
scarred, and he pale as a ghost fresh from Pandemonium.&#8217; After
looking for some time, slowly and cautiously approaching, he broke
out: &#8216;My God, Lorenzo! in the name of heaven, what, Lorenzo, has
happened?&#8217; I felt my heart strangely swell in my bosom, and I
could scarcely believe my sight. &#8216;Can it be?&#8217; I thought,
&#8216;can it be that this is a familiar white face?&#8217; I could
not speak; my heart could only pour out its emotions in the streaming
tears that flowed most freely over my face. When I recovered myself
sufficiently, I began to speak of the fate of the rest of the family.
They could not speak, some of them; those tender-hearted women wept
most bitterly, and sobbed aloud, begging me to desist, and hide the
rest of the truth from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They immediately chose the course of prudence, and
resolved not to venture with so small a company, where we had met
such a doom. Mr. Wilder prepared me some bread and milk, which,
without any necessity for a sharpening process, my appetite, for
some reason, relished very well. They traveled a few miles on the
back track that night, and camped. I received every attention and
kindness that a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> sympathy could minister. We camped where
a gurgling spring sent the clear cold water to the surface; and here
I refreshed myself with draughts of the purest of beverages, cleansed
my wounds, and bathed my aching head and bruised body in one of
nature&#8217;s own baths. The next day we were safe at Pimole ere night
came on. When the Indians learned what had happened, they, with much
vehemence, charged it upon the Yumas; but for this we made allowance,
as a deadly hostility burned between these tribes. Mr. Kelly and Mr.
Wilder resolved upon proceeding immediately to the place of massacre,
and burying the dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Accordingly, early the next day, with two Mexicans and
several Pimoles, they started. They returned after an absence of three
days, and reported that they could find but little more than the bones
of six persons, and that they were able to find and distinguish the
bodies of all but those of Olive and Mary Ann. If they had found the
bodies of my sisters the news would have been less dreadful to me
than the tidings that they had been carried off by the Indians. But
my suspicions were now confirmed, and I could only see them as the
victims of a barbarous captivity. During their absence, and for some
time after, I was severely and dangerously ill, but with the kind
attention and nursing rendered me I began after a week to revive.
We were now only waiting the coming that way of some persons<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> who
might be westward bound, to accompany them to California. When we had
been there two weeks, six men came into Pimole, who, on learning of
our situation, kindly consented to keep with us until we could reach
Fort Yuma. The Kellys and Wilders had some time before abandoned their
notion of a year&#8217;s stay at Pimole. We were soon again upon that
road, with every step of which I now had a painful familiarity. On
the sixth day we reached that place, of all others the most deeply
memory-written. I have no power to describe, nor can tongue or pen
proclaim the feelings that heaved my sorrowing heart as I reached the
fatal spot. I could hear still the echo of those wild shrieks and
hellish whoops, reverberating along the mountain cliffs! those groans,
<em>those awful groans</em>, could it be my imagination, or did they yet live
in pleading echo among the numerous caverns on either hand? Every
footfall startled me, and seemed to be an intruder upon the chambers of
the dead!</p>

<p>&#8220;There were dark thoughts in my mind, and I felt that this
was a charnel-house that had plundered our household of its bloom, its
childhood, and its stay! I marked the precise spot where the work of
death commenced. My eyes would then gaze anxiously and long upon the
high, wild mountains, with their forests and peaks that now embosomed
all of my blood that were still alive! I traced the footprints of their
captors, and of those who had laid my parents<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> beneath my feet. I
sighed to wrap myself in their death-robe, and with them sleep my long,
last sleep! But it was haunted ground, and to tarry there alive was
more dreadful than the thought of sharing their repose. I hastened
away. I pray God to save me in future from the dark thoughts that
gloomed my mind on turning my back upon that spot; and the reader from
experiencing kindred sorrow. With the exception of about eighteen
miles of desert, we had a comfortable week of travel to Fort Yuma. I
still suffered much, at times was seriously worse, so that my life
was despaired of; but more acute were my mental than my physical
sufferings.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the Fort every possible kindness, with the best of medical
skill, ministered to my comfort and hastened my recovery. To Dr. Hewitt
I owe, and must forever owe, a debt of gratitude which I can never
return. The sense of obligations I still cherish finds but a poor
expression in words. He became a parent to me; and kindly extended his
guardianship and unabating kindness, when the force was moved to San
Diego, and then he took me to San Francisco, at a time when, but for
his counsel and his affectionate oversight, I might have been turned
out to wreck upon the cold world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we found that Doctor Lecount had done all in his
power to get up and hasten a party of men to our relief; but he
was prevented by the commander, a Mr. Heinsalman, who was guilty
of an unexplainable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112"
id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> if not an inexcusable delay&mdash;a
delay that was an affliction to the doctor, and a calamity to us.
He seemed deaf to every appeal for us in our distressed condition.
His conduct, if we had been a pack of hungry wolves, could not have
exhibited more total recklessness. The fact of our condition reached
the Fort at almost as early an hour as it would if the animals of
the doctor had been retained, and there were a number of humane men
at the Fort who volunteered to rush to our relief; but no permission
could be obtained from the commander. If he still lives, it is to
know and remember, that by a prompt action at that time, according
to the behests and impulse of a principle of &#8216;humanity to
man,&#8217; he would have averted our dreadful doom. No language can
fathom such cruelty. He was placed there to protect the defenseless of
his countrymen; and to suffer an almost destitute family, struggling
amid dangers and difficulties, to perish for want of relief that
he knew he might have extended, rolls upon him a responsibility in
the inhuman tragedy that followed his neglect, that will haunt him
through eternity. There were men there who nobly stepped forward to
assume the danger and labor of the prayed-for relief, and around them
clusters the light of gratitude, the incense of the good; but he who
neglects the destitute, the hungry, the imperiled, proclaims his
companionship with misanthropists, and hews his own road to a prejudged
disgrace. After several days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113"
id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> he reluctantly sent out two men, who
hastened on toward Pimole until they came to the place of the massacre,
and finding what had happened, and that the delay had been followed by
such a brutal murder of the family for whose safety and rescue they had
burned to encounter the perils of this desert way, sick at heart, and
indignant at this cruel, let-alone policy, they returned to the Fort;
though not until they had exhausted their scant supply of provisions in
search of the girls, of whose captivity they had learned. May Heaven
bless these benefactors, and pour softening influences upon their
hard-hearted commander.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mind instinctively pauses, and, suspended between wonder and
horror, dwells with most intense interest upon a scene like the one
presented above. Look at the faint pointings to the reality, yet
the best that art can inscribe, furnished by the plate. Two timid
girls, one scarcely fourteen, the other a delicate, sweet-spirited
girl of not eight summers. Trembling with fear, swaying and reeling
under the wild storm of a catastrophe bursting upon them when they
had been lulled into the belief that their danger-thronged path
had been well-nigh passed, and the fury of which exceeded all that
the most excited imagination could have painted, these two girls,
eye-witnesses to a brutal, bloody affray which had smitten father,
mother, brothers, and sisters, robbing them in an instant of friends
and friendly protection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114"
id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> and cast themselves, they knew not
where, upon the perpetrators of all this butchery, whose tender mercies
they had only to expect would be cruelty itself. That brother, that
oldest brother, weltering in his blood, perfectly conscious of all
that was transpiring. The girls wishing that a kindred fate had ended
their own sufferings, and preserved them by a horrible death from a
more horrible after-part, placing them beyond the reach of savage arm
and ferocity. O what an hour was that! What a world of paralyzing
agonies were pressed into that one short hour! It was an &#8220;ocean
in a tear, a whirlwind in a sigh, an eternity in a moment.&#8221;
Unoffending, innocent, yet their very souls throbbing with woe they had
never merited. See them but a little before, wearied with the present,
but happy in the prospect of a fast approaching termination of their
journey. A band of Indians, stalwart, stout, and fierce-looking came
into the camp, scantily clad, and what covering they had borrowed from
the wild beasts, as if to furnish an appropriate badge of their savage
nature and design. They cover their weapons under their wolf-skins;
they warily steal upon this unprotected family, and by deceiving
pretenses of friendship blunt their apprehensions of danger, and make
them oblivious of a gathering doom. They smoke the pacific pipe,
and call themselves Pimoles who are on their way to Fort Yuma. Then
secretly they concoct their hellish plot in their own tongue,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with naught but an involuntary glance of their serpent eyes to flash
or indicate the infernality of their treacherous hearts. When every
preparation is made by the family to proceed, no defense studied or
thought necessary, then these hideous man-animals spring upon them
with rough war-clubs and murder them in cold blood; and, as if to
strew their hellish way with the greatest possible amount of anguish,
they compel these two girls to witness all the barbarity that broke
upon the rest, and to read therein what horrors hung upon their own
future living death. O what depths and deeds of darkness and crime
are sometimes locked up in that heart where the harmonies of a
passion-restraining principle and reason have never been waked up! How
slender every foundation for any forecasting upon the character of its
doings, when trying emergences are left an appeal to its untamed and
unregulated propensities!</p>

<p>The work of plunder follows the work of slaughter. The dead bodies
were thrown about in the rudest manner, and pockets searched, boxes
broken and plundered, and soon as they are fully convinced that the
work of spoils-taking is completed, and they discover no signs of
remaining life (which they hunted for diligently) to awaken suspicions
of detection, they prepare with live spoils, human and brute, to
depart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon after,&#8221; continues Olive, &#8220;we camped. A<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> fire
was struck by means of flints and wild cotton, which they carried for
the purpose. The cattle were allowed to range upon the rock-feed, which
abounded; and even with this unnatural provision, they were secure
against being impelled by hunger far from camp, as they scarcely had
strength to move. Then came the solid dough, made of water and flour,
baked stone-hard in the hot ashes, and then soaked in bean-soup; then
the smoking of pipes by some, while others lounged lazily about the
camp, filled up the hour of our tarrying here. Food was offered me,
but how could I eat to prolong a life I now loathed. I felt neither
sensations of hunger nor a desire to live. Could I have done it, I
should probably have ended my life during moments of half-delirious,
crushing anguish, that some of the time rolled upon me with a force
sufficient to divide soul from body. But I was narrowly watched by
those worse than fiends, to whom every expression of my grief was
occasion for merry-making. I dwelt upon these awful realities, yet,
at times, such I could not think them to be, until my thoughts would
become confused. Mangled as I knew they were, I longed to go back
and take one look, one long, last, farewell look in the faces of
my parents and those dear brothers. Could I but go back and press
the hands of those dear ones, though cold in death, I would then
consent to go on! There was Lucy, about seventeen years of age, a
dear girl of a sweet, mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117"
id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> spirit, never angry. She had been a
mother to me when our parents were absent or sick. She had borne the
peculiar burden falling upon the oldest of a family of children, with
evenness of temper and womanly fortitude. &#8216;Why,&#8217; my heart
inquired, &#8216;should she be thus cut off and I left?&#8217; Lorenzo
I supposed dead, for I saw him fall to the ground by the first blow
that was struck, and afterward saw them take from him hat and shoes,
and drag him to the brink of the hill by the feet. Supposing they would
dash him upon the rocks below, I turned away, unable to witness more!
Royse, a playful, gleeful boy, full of health and happiness, stood a
moment horror-struck as he witnessed the commencement of the carnage,
being furthest from the Indians. As they came up to him, he gave one
wild, piercing scream, and then sank to the earth under the club! I saw
him when the death-struggle drew his little frame into convulsions,
and then he seemed to swoon away; a low moan, a slight heaving of the
bosom, and he quietly sank into the arms of death. Little C. A. had not
as yet seen four summers; she was a cherub girl. She, with her little
brother, twenty months younger, had been saved the torments of fear
that had seized the rest of us from the time of the appearance of the
Indians. They were too young to catch the flashes of fear that played
upon the countenances of the elder children and their parents, and
were happily trustful when our father, with<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> forced composure, bade
us not be afraid! The struggles of these two dear little ones were
short. My mother screamed, I turned, I saw her with her youngest child
clasped in her arms, and the blows of the war-club falling upon her
and the child. I sprang toward her, uttered a shriek, and found myself
joining her in calling most earnestly for help. But I had no sooner
started toward her than I was seized and thrown back by my overseer.
I turned around, found my head beginning to reel in dizziness, and
fainting fell to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reader can perhaps imagine the nature of my thoughts
while standing at that camp-fire, with my sister clinging to me in
convulsive sobs and groans. From fear of the Indians, whose frowns
and threats, mingled with hellish jests, were constantly glaring upon
us, she struggled to repress and prevent any outburst of the grief
that seemed to tear her little heart. And when her feelings became
uncontrollable, she would hide her head in my arms, and most piteously
sob aloud, but she was immediately hushed by the brandishing of a
war-club over her head.</p>

    <p>THE CAPTIVES AT THE INDIAN CAMP-FIRE.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;While in this camp, awaiting the finished meal, and
just after twilight, the full moon arose and looked in upon our
rock-girt gorge with a majesty and sereneness that seemed to mock
our changeful doom. Indeed a more beautiful moonrise I never saw.
The sky was clear, the wind had hushed its roar, and laid by its
fury; the larger and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119"
id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> brilliant of the starry throng stood
out clear above, despite the superior light of the moon, which had
blushed the lesser ones into obscurity. As that moon mounted the
cloudless east, yet tinged with the last stray beauties of twilight,
and sent its first mild glories along the surrounding peaks, the scene
of illumined heights, and dark, cavernous, shade-clad hill-sides
and gorges, was grand, and to a mind unfettered with woe would
have lent the inspiration of song. I looked upon those gorges and
vales, with their deeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> of gloom, and then upon the moon-kissed
ridges that formed boundaries of light to limit their shadows! I
thought the former a fit exponent of my heart&#8217;s realizations, and
the whole an impressive illustration of the contrast between my present
and the recent past. That moon, ordinarily so welcome, and that seemed
supernaturally empowered to clothe the barren heights with a richer
than nature&#8217;s verdure robes, and so cheering to us only a few
evenings previous while winding our way over that dusty road, had now
suddenly put on a robe of sackcloth. All was still, save the chattering
of our captors, and the sharp, irregular howling of the coyotes, who
perform most of their odes in the night, and frequently made it hideous
from twilight to twilight again.</p>

<p>&#8220;O how much crowded into that short hour spent at the first
camp after leaving the scene of death and sleeping previous! Ignorant
of the purposes of our own preservation, we could only wait in
breathless anxiety the movements of our merciless lords. I then began
to meditate upon leaving those parents, brothers and sisters; I looked
up and saw the uncovered bows strung over the wagon, the cloth of which
had been torn off by the Indians. I knew that it designated the spot
where horror and affection lingered. I meditated upon the past, the
present, and the future. The moon, gradually ascending the sky, was
fast breaking in upon the deep-shade spots that at her first rising
had contended with ridges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> light spread about them. <em>That</em> moon
had witnessed the night before my childish but sincerest vow, that I
would never be taken alive by Indian savages, and was now laughing at
the frailty of the resolution and the abruptness with which the fears
to which it pointed had become reality! <em>That</em> moon had smiled on many,
very many hours spent in lands far away in childish glee, romps and
sports prolonged, near the home-hearth and grass-plotted door-yard,
long after the cool evening breezes had fanned away the sultry air
of the day. The very intonations of the voices that had swelled and
echoed in those uncaring hours of glee came back to me now, to rehearse
in the ears of a present, insupportable sorrow, the music of past,
but happier days. This hour, <em>this moon-lit hour</em>, was one most dear
and exclusive to the gushing forth of the heart&#8217;s unrestrained
overflowings of happiness. Where are now those girls and boys? where
now are those who gathered about me, and over whose sun-tanned but
ruddy cheeks had stolen the unbidden tear at the hour of parting; or,
with an artless simplicity, the heart&#8217;s &#8216;good-by&#8217;
was repeated o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er again? Is this moon now bearing
the same unmingled smile to them as when it looked upon our mutual
evening promenadings? or has it put on the somber hues that seem to
tinge its wonted brightness to me, heralding the color of our fate,
and hinting of our sorrow? These, all these, and many more kindred
reflections found way to, and strung the heart&#8217;s saddest<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
notes. And as memory and present consciousness told me of those days
and evenings gone&mdash;gone never to be repeated&mdash;I became sick
of life, and resolved upon stopping its currents with my own hands;
and but for the yearning anxiety that bent over little Mary Ann, I
should have only waited the opportunity to have executed my desperate
purpose. The strolls to school, arm-in-arm with the now remembered,
but abandoned partners of the blissful past, on the summer morn; the
windings and wanderings upon the distinctly remembered strawberry
patches at sultry noon; the evening walks for the cows, when the
setting sun and the coming on of cloudless, stormless, cool evenings,
clothed all nature with unwonted loveliness; together with the sad
present, that furnished so unexpected and tormenting a contrast with
all before, would rush again upon me, bringing the breath of dark,
suicidal thoughts to fire up the <em>first hour of a camp among the
Indians</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>But these harrowing meditations are suddenly interrupted; cattle are
placed in order for traveling; five of the Indians are put in charge
of the girls, and welcome or unwelcome they must away they knew not
where.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were started and kept upon a rapid pace for several
hours. One of the Indians takes the lead, Mary Ann and myself follow,
bareheaded and shoeless, the Indians having taken off our shoes
and head covering. We were traveling at a rate, as we soon<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
learned, much beyond our strength. Soon the light of the camp-fire
was hid, and as my eye turned, full of tears, in search of the
sleeping-place of my kindred, it could not be distinguished from the
peaks and rocks about it. Every slackening of our pace and utterance
of grief, however, was the signal for new threats, and the suspended
war-club, with the fiendish &#8216;<i>Yokoa</i>&#8217; in our ears,
repressed all expression of sorrow, and pushed us on up steeper ascents
and bolder hills with a quickened step. We must have traveled at the
rate of four or five miles an hour. Our feet were soon lacerated, as
in shadowed places we were unable to pick our way, and were frequently
stumbling upon stones and rocks, which made them bleed freely. Little
Mary Ann soon became unable to proceed at the rate we had been keeping,
and sank down after a few miles, saying she could not go. After
threatening and beating her considerably, and finding this treatment as
well as my entreaties useless, they threatened to dispatch and leave
her, and showed by their movements and gestures that they had fully
come to this determination. At this I knew not what to do; I only
wished that if they should do this I might be left with her. She seemed
to have become utterly fearless of death, and said she had rather die
than live. These inhuman wretches sought by every possible rudeness
and abuse to rouse her fears and compel her on; but all in vain. I
resolved, in the event of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> being left, to cling to her, and thus
compel them to dispose of us as they had the remainder of the family,
and leave us upon a neighboring hill. My fears were that I could not
succeed in my desperate purpose, and I fully believed they would kill
her, and probably compel me on with them. This fear induced me to use
every possible plea that I could make known to them to preserve her
life; besides, at every step a faint hope of release shone upon my
heart; that hope had a power to comfort and keep me up. While thus
halting, one of the stout Indians dislodged his pack, and putting it
upon the shoulders of another Indian, rudely threw Mary Ann across his
back, and with vengeance in his eye bounded on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I meditated the desperate resolution to utterly
refuse to proceed, but was held back alone by my yearning for that
helpless sister. Again, I found my strength failing, and that unless a
rest could be soon granted I <em>must</em> yield to faintness and weariness,
and bide the consequences; thus I passed the dreadful hours up to
midnight. The moanings and sobbings of Mary Ann had now ceased; not
knowing but she was dead, I managed to look in her face, and found her
eyes opening and shutting alternately, as if in an effort to wake,
but still unable to sleep; I spoke to her but received no answer.
We could not converse without exciting the fiendish rage of our
enemies. Mary Ann seemed to have become utterly indifferent to all
about her; and, wrapped in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"
id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> dreamy reverie, relieved of all care
of life or death, presenting the appearance of one who had simply the
consciousness that some strange, unaccountable event had happened, and
in its bewildering effects she was content to remain. Our way had been
mostly over a succession of small bluff points of high mountain chains,
these letting down to a rough winding valley, running principally
northeast. These small rock hills that formed the bottom of the high
cliffs on either side, were rough, with no perceptible trail. We halted
for a few moments about the middle of the night; besides this we had no
rest until about noon of the next day, when we came to an open place of
a few acres of level, sandy soil, adorned with an occasional thrifty,
beautiful tree, but high and seemingly impassable mountains hemming
us in on every side. This appeared to be to our captors a familiar
retreat. Almost exhausted, and suffering extremely, I dragged myself
up to the place of halt, hoping that we had completed the travel of
that day. We had tarried about two hours when the rest of the band,
who had taken the stock in another direction, came up. They had with
them two oxen and the horse. The rest of the stock, we afterward
learned, had been killed and hung up to dry, awaiting the roving of
this plundering band when another expedition should lead them that
way. Here they immediately proceeded to kill the other two. This being
done they sliced them up, and closely packed<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> the parcels in equalized
packages for their backs. They then broiled some of the meat on the
fire, and prepared another meal of this and burned dough and bean soup.
They offered us of their fare and we ate with a good appetite. Never
did the tender, well-prepared veal steak at home relish better than
the tough, stringy piece of meat about the size of the hand, given us
by our captors, and which with burned dough and a little bean soup
constituted our meal. We were very sleepy, but such was my pain and
suffering I could not sleep. They endeavored now to compel Mary Ann
again to go on foot; but this she could not do, and after beating her
again, all of which she took without a murmur, one of them again took
her upon his shoulder and we started. I had not gone far before I found
it impossible to proceed on account of the soreness of my feet. They
then gave me something very much of the substance of sole-leather which
they tied upon the bottom of my feet. This was a relief, and though
suffering much from thirst and the pain of over-exertion, I was enabled
to keep up with the heavy-laden Indians. We halted in a snug, dark
ravine about ten o&#8217;clock that night, and preparations were at
once made for a night&#8217;s stay. My present suffering had now made
me almost callous as to the past, and never did rest seem so sweet as
when I saw they were about to encamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the last six hours they had whipped<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Mary Ann into walking. We were now shown a soft place in the sand,
and directed to it as the place of our rest; and with two of our
own blankets thrown over us, and three savages encircling us, (for
protection of course!) were soon, despite our physical sufferings, in
a dreamy and troubled sleep. The most frightful scenes of butchery
and suffering followed into every moment&#8217;s slumber. We were not
roused until a full twilight had shone in upon our beautiful little
ravine retreat. The breakfast was served up, consisting of beef,
burned dough, and beans, instead of beans, burned dough, and beef,
as usual. The sun was now fairly upon us when, like cattle, we were
driven forth to another day&#8217;s travel. The roughest road (if road
be a proper term) over which I ever passed, in all my captivity, was
that day&#8217;s route. Twice during the day, I gave up, and told Mary
I must consent to be murdered and left, for proceed I would not. But
this they were not inclined to allow. When I could not be driven, I
was pushed and hauled along. Stubs, rocks, and gravel-strewn mountain
sides hedged up and embittered the travel of the whole day. <em>That day</em>
is among the few days of my dreary stay among the savages, marked by
the most pain and suffering ever endured. I have since learned that
they hurried for fear of the whites, emigrant trains of whom were
not unfrequently passing that way. For protection they kept a close
watch, having not less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> three guards or sentinels stationed at
a little distance from each camp we made during the entire night. I
have since thought much upon the fear manifested by these reputed brave
barbarians. They indeed seem to be borne down with the most tormenting
fear for their personal safety at all times, at home, or roaming for
plunder or hunt. And yet courage is made a virtue among them, while
cowardice is the unpardonable sin. When compelled to meet death, they
seem to muster a sullen obstinate defiance of their doom, that makes
the most of a dreaded necessity, rather than seek a preparation to meet
it with a submission which they often dissemble but never possess.</p>

<p>&#8220;About noon we were suddenly surprised by coming upon a band
of Indians, eleven in number. They emerged from behind a rock point
that set out into a low, dark ravine, through which we were passing,
and every one of them was armed with bows and arrows. When they came
up they were jabbering and gesturing in the most excited manner, with
eyes fastened upon me. While some of them were earnestly conversing
with members of our band, two of them stealthily crept around us, and
one of them by his gestures and excited talk, plainly showed hostile
intentions toward us, which our captors watched with a close eye.
Suddenly one of them strung his bow, and let fly an arrow at me, which
pierced my dress, doing me no harm.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was in the act, as also the other, of hurling the second,
when two of our number sprang toward them with their clubs, while two
others snatched us one side, placing themselves between us and the
drawn bows. By this time a strong Apache had the Indian by a firm
grasp, and compelled him to desist. It was with difficulty they could
be shaken off, or their murderous purpose prevented. At one time there
was likely to be a general fight with this band (as I afterward learned
them to be) of land pirates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130"
id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The reason, as I afterward came to know, of the conduct
of this Indian, was that he had lost a brother in an affray with
the whites upon this same Santa F&eacute; route, and he had sworn
not to allow the first opportunity to escape without avenging his
brother&#8217;s blood by taking the life of an American. Had their
number been larger a serious engagement would have taken place, and
my life have probably been sacrificed to this fiend&#8217;s revenge.
During the skirmish of words that preceded and for some time followed
this attempt upon my life, I felt but little anxiety, for there was
little reason to hope but that we must both perish at the best, and
to me it mattered little how soon. Friends we had none; succor, or
sympathy, or help, we had no reason to think could follow us into this
wild, unknown region; and the only question was whether we should be
murdered inch by inch, or find a sudden though savage termination to
our dreadful condition, and sleep at once quietly beyond the reach or
brutality of these fiends in death&#8217;s embrace. Indeed death seemed
the only release proffered from any source. If I had before known that
the arrow would lodge in life&#8217;s vitals, I doubt whether it would
have awakened a nerve or moved a muscle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We traveled until about midnight, when our captors called
a halt, and gave us to understand we might sleep for the remainder
of the night. But, jaded as we were, and enduring as we were<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
all manner of pain, these were not more in the way of sleep than the
wild current of our anxious thoughts and meditations, which we found
it impossible to arrest or to leave with the dead bodies of our dear
kindred. There was scarcely a moment when the mind&#8217;s consent
could be gained for sleep. Well do I remember to have spent the larger
proportion of that half of a night in gazing upon the stars, counting
those directly over head, calling the names I had been taught to give
to certain of the planets, pointing out to my sister the old dipper,
and seeking to arrest and relieve her sadness by referring to the views
we had taken of these from the old grass-clad door-yard in front of
our humble cottage in Illinois. We spoke of the probability that these
might now be the objects of attention and sight to eyes far away; to
eyes familiar, the gleam of whose kindly radiance had so oft met ours,
and with the strength of whose vision we had so delightfully tried
our own in thus star-gazing. These scenes of a past yet unfinished
childhood came rushing upon the mind, bidding it away over the distance
that now separated them and their present occupants from us, and to
think mournfully of the still wider variance that separated their
allotment from ours. Strange as it may appear, scenes and woes like
those pressing upon us had a power to bind all sensitiveness about
our fate. Indeed, indifference is the last retreat of desperation.
The recklessness observed in the Indians, their habits<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> of
subsistence, and all their manner and bearing toward their captives,
could lead them only to expect that by starvation or assassination they
must soon become the victims of a brutal fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the third day we came suddenly in sight of a cluster of
low, thatched huts, each having an opening near the ground leading into
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was soon visible from the flashing eyes and animated countenances
of the Indians, that they were nearing some place of attraction, and to
which anxious and interesting desire had been pointing. To two young
girls, having traveled on foot two hundred miles in three days; with
swollen feet and limbs, lame, exhausted, not yet four days remove from
the loss of parents, brothers, and sisters, and torn from them, too,
in the most brutal manner; away in the deeps of forests and mountains,
upon the desolation of which the glad light or sound of civilization
never yet broke; with no guides or protectors, rudely, inhumanly driven
by untutored, untamed savages, the sight of the dwelling-places of man,
however coarse or unseemly, was no very unwelcome scene. With all the
dread possibilities, therefore, that might await them at any moment,
nevertheless to get even into an Indian camp was home.</p>

  </a>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We were soon ushered into camp, amid shouts and song, wild
dancing, and the crudest, most irregular music that ever ranter
sung, or delighted the ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133"
id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> of an unrestrained superstition. They
lifted us on the top of a pile of brush and bark, then formed a circle
about us of men, women, and children of all ages and sizes, some naked,
some dressed in blankets, some in skins, some in bark. Music then
commenced, which consisted of pounding upon stones with clubs and horn,
and the drawing of a small string like a fiddle-bow across distended
bark. They ran, and jumped, and danced in the wildest and most furious
manner about us, but keeping a regular circle.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> Each, on coming to
a certain point in the circle, marked by a removed piece of turf
in the ground, would bend himself or herself nearly to the ground,
uttering at the same time a most frightful yell, and making a violent
gesticulation and stamping. Frequently on coming near us, as they would
do in each evolution, they would spit in our face, throw dirt upon us,
or slightly strike us with their hand, managing, by every possible
means, to give us an early and thorough impression of their barbarity,
cruelty, and obscenity. The little boys and girls, especially, would
make the older ones merry by thus taunting us. It seemed during all
this wild and disgusting performance, that their main ambition was to
exhibit their superiority over us, and the low, earnest, intense hate
they bore toward our race. And this they most effectually succeeded
in accomplishing, together with a disgusting view of the obscenity,
vulgarity, and grossness of their hearts, and the mean, despicable,
revengeful dispositions that burn with hellish fury within their
untamed bosoms.</p>

<p>&#8220;We soon saw that these bravadoes had made themselves
great men at home. They had made themselves a name by the exploits
of the past week. They had wantonly set upon a laboring family of
nine persons, unprotected, and worn to fatigue by the toils of
a long journey, without any mode of defense, and had inhumanly
slaughtered seven of them, taken two inoffensive girls into a
barbarous captivity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135"
id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> drove them two hundred miles in three
days without that mercy which civilization awards to the brute; taken
a few sacks of smoked, soot-covered cow-meat, a few beans, a little
clothing, and one horse! By their account, and we afterward ascertained
that they have a mode of calculating distances with wonderful accuracy,
we had come indeed over two hundred and fifty miles, inside of eighty
hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;This may seem incredible to the reader, but the rate at which
we were hurried on, the little rest that was granted, and subsequent
knowledge gained of their traveling rate, confirms the assertion made
by themselves as to the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We found the tribe to consist of about three hundred, living
in all the extremes of filth and degradation that the most abandoned
humanity ever fathomed. Little had the inexperience and totally
different habits of life, from which these reflections are made, of the
knowledge or judgment to imagine or picture the low grossness to which
unrestrained, uneducated passions can sink the human heart and life.
Their mode of dress, (but little dress they had!) was needlessly and
shockingly indecent, when the material of which their scanty clothing
consists would, by an industrious habit and hand, have clothed them to
the dictates of comfort and modesty.</p>

<p>&#8220;They subsisted principally upon deer, quail, and rabbit,
with an occasional mixture of roots from the ground. And even this
dealt out with the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136"
id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> sparing and parsimonious hand, and in
quantity only up to a stern necessity; and this, not because of poverty
in the supply, but to feed and gratify a laziness that would not gather
or hunt it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only when the insatiable and half-starved appetite
of the members was satisfied, when unusual abundance chanced to
come in, that their captives could be allowed a morsel; and then
their chance was that of the dogs, with whom they might share the
crumbs. Their meat was boiled with water in a &#8216;Tusquin,&#8217;
(clay kettle,) and this meat-mush or soup was the staple of food
among them, and of this they were frequently short, and obliged to
quiet themselves with meted out allowance; to their captives it was
always thus meted out. At times game in the immediate vicinity was
scarce, and their indolence would not let them go forth to the chase
upon the mountains and in the valleys a little distance, where they
acknowledged it plenty, only in cases of impending starvation. During
the time of captivity among them, very frequently were whole days spent
without a morsel, and then when the hunter returned with game, he was
surrounded with crowds hungry as a pack of wolves to devour it, and
the bits and leavings were tauntingly thrown to &#8216;Onatas,&#8217;
saying, &#8216;You have been fed too well; we will teach you to live
on little.&#8217; Besides all this, they were disbelievers in the
propriety of treating female youth to meat, or of allowing it to become
their article of subsistence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137"
id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> which, considering their main reliance
as a tribe upon game, was equal to dooming their females to starvation.
And this result of their theory became a mournful and constantly
recurring fact. According to their physiology the female, especially
the young female, should be allowed meat only when necessary to prevent
starvation. Their own female children frequently died, and those alive,
old and young, were sickly and dwarfish generally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Several times were their late captives brought near a horrid
death ere they could be persuaded to so waive their superstitious
notions as to give them a saving crumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Apaches were without any settled habits of industry.
They tilled not. It was a marvel to see how little was required to
keep them alive; yet they were capable of the greatest endurance when
occasion taxed their strength. They ate worms, grasshoppers, reptiles,
<em>all flesh</em>, and were, perhaps, living exhibitions of a certain theory
by which the nature of the animal eaten leaves its imprint upon the man
or human being who devours it. For whole days, when scarcely a morsel
for another meal was in the camp, would those stout, robust, lazy lumps
of a degraded humanity lounge in the sun or by the gurgling spring;
at noon in the shade or on the shelves of the mountains surrounding,
utterly reckless of their situation, or of the doom their idleness
might bring upon the whole tribe. Their women were the laborers<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> and
principal burden-bearers, and during all our captivity,&#8221; says
Olive, &#8220;it was our lot to serve under these enslaved women, with
a severity more intolerable than that to which they were subjected
by their merciless lords. They invented modes, and seemed to create
necessities of labor, that they might gratify themselves by taxing us
to the utmost, and even took unwarranted delight in whipping us on
beyond our strength. And all their requests and exactions were couched
in the most insulting and taunting language and manner, as it then
seemed, and as they had the frankness soon to confess, to fume their
hate against the race to whom we belonged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Often under the frown and lash were we compelled to labor
for whole days upon an allowance amply sufficient to starve a common
dandy civilized idler, and those days of toil wrung out at the instance
of children younger than ourselves, who were set as our task-masters.
They knew nothing of cultivating the soil. After we had learned their
language enough to talk with them, we ventured to speak to them of the
way by which we had lived, of the tilling of the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;They had soil that might have produced, but most of them
had an abhorrence of all that might be said of the superior blessings
of industry and the American civilization. Yet there were those,
especially among the females and the younger members of the tribe, who
asked frequent questions, and with eagerness,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> of our mode of life. For
some time after coming among them, Mary Ann was very ill. The fatigue,
the cruelties of the journey, nearly cost her her life; yet in all
her weakness, sickness, and pinings, they treated her with all the
heartlessness of a dog. She would often say to me: &#8216;Olive, I must
starve unless I can get something more to eat;&#8217; yet it was only
when she was utterly disabled that they would allow her a respite from
some daily menial service. We have often taken the time which was given
to gather roots for our lazy captors, to gather and eat ourselves;
and had it not been for supplies obtained by such means, we must have
perished. But the physical sufferings of this state were light when
compared with the fear and anguish of mind; the bitter fate upon us,
the dismal remembrances that harassed us, the knowledge of a bright
past and a dark future by which we were compassed, these, all these
belabored every waking moment, and crowded the wonted hours of sleep
with terrible forebodings of a worse fate still ahead. Each day seemed
to be allotted its own peculiar woes; some circumstance, some new event
would arise, touching and enkindling its own class of bitter emotions.
We were compelled to heed every whimper and cry of their little urchins
with promptness, and fully, under no less penalty than a severe
beating, and that in the most severe manner. These every-day usages and
occurrences would awaken thorny reflections<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> upon our changed and
prison life. There was no beauty, no loveliness, no attractions in the
country possessed by these unlovely creatures to make it pleasant, if
there had been the blotting out of all the dreadful realities that
had marked our way to it, or the absence of the cruelties that made
our stay a living death. Often has my little sister come to me with
a heart surcharged with grief, and the big tears standing in her
eye, or perhaps sobbing most convulsively over the maltreatment and
chastisement that had met her good intentions, for she ever tried to
please them, and most piteously would she say: &#8216;How long, O how
long, dear Olive, must we stay here; can we never get away? do you not
think they intend to kill us? O! they are so ugly and savage!&#8217;
Sometimes I would tell her that I saw but little chance for escape;
that we had better be good and ready for any fate, and try to wait in
submission for our lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;She would dry her eyes, wipe the tears away, and not seldom
have I known her to return with a look of pensive thoughtfulness,
and that eye, bright and glistening with the light of a new-born
thought, as she would say: &#8216;I know what we can do; we can ask
God. He can deliver us, or give us grace to bear our troubles.&#8217;
It was our custom to go by ourselves and commit ourselves to God in
faithful prayer every day; and this we would do after we laid our
weary frames upon our sand bed to rest, if no other opportunity<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
offered. This custom had been inculcated in us by a fond and devoted
mother, and well now did we remember with what affection she assured us
that we would find it a comfort and support to thus carry our trials
and troubles to our heavenly Father in after years; though little did
she realize the exceedingly bitter grief that would make these lessons
of piety so sweet to our hearts. Too sadly did they prove true. Often
were the times when we were sent some distance to bring water and wood
for the comfort of lazy men, selected for the grateful observance of
this only joyful employment that occupied any of those dark days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seldom during our stay here were we cheered with any
knowledge or circumstance that bid us hope for our escape. Hours were
spent by us in talking of trying the experiment. Mary often would
say: &#8216;I can find the way out, and I can go the whole distance
as quick as they.&#8217; Several times, after cruel treatment, or the
passing of danger from starvation, have we made the resolution, and
set the time for executing it, but were not bold enough to undertake
it. Yet we were not without <em>all</em> or <em>any</em> hope. A word dropped
by our captors concerning their occasional trips, made by small
bands of them to some region of the whites, some knowledge we would
accidentally gain of our latitude and locality, would animate our
breasts with the hope of a future relief, breaking like a small ray
of light from some distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142"
id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> luminous object upon the eye of our
faith. But it was only when our minds dwelt upon the power of the
Highest, on an overruling Providence, that we could feel that there was
any possibility of an extrication from our uncheered prison life.</p>

<p>&#8220;After we had been among these Apaches several months, their
conduct toward us somewhat changed. They became more lenient and
merciful, especially to my sister. She always met their abuse with
a mild, patient spirit and deportment, and with an intrepidity and
fortitude beyond what might have been expected from her age. This
spirit, which she always bore, I could plainly see was working its
effect upon some of them; so that, especially on the part of those
females connected in some way with the household of the chief, and who
had the principal control of us, we could plainly see more forbearance,
kindness, and interest exhibited toward their captives. This, slight
as was the change, was a great relief to my mind, and comfort to Mary
Ann. We had learned their language so as to hold converse with them
quite understandingly, after a few months among them. They were much
disposed at times to draw us into conversation; they asked our ages,
inquired after our former place of living, and when we told them of
the distance we had come to reach our home among them, they greatly
marveled. They would gather about us frequently in large numbers,
and ply their curious questions with eagerness and seeming<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
interest, asking how many of the white folks there were; how far the
big ocean extended; and on being told of the two main oceans, they
asked if the whites possessed the other big world on the east of the
Atlantic; if there were any Indians there; particularly they would
question us as to the number of the &#8216;Americanos,&#8217; (this
term they obtained among the Mexicans, and it was the one by which they
invariably designated our people.) When we told them of the number
of the whites, and of their rapid increase, they were apparently
incredulous, and some of them would become angry, and accuse us of
lying, and wishing to make them believe a lie. They wanted to know
how women were treated, and if a man was allowed more than one wife;
inquired particularly how and by what means a subsistence was gained
by us. In this latter question we could discern an interest that did
not inspire any of their other queries. Bad as they are, they are very
curious to know the secret of the success and increase of the whites.
We tried to tell them of the knowledge the whites possessed, of the
well-founded belief they had that the stars above us were peopled by
human beings, and of the fact that the distance to these far-off worlds
had been measured by the whites. They wished to know if any of us had
been there; this they asked in a taunting manner, exhibiting in irony
and sarcasm their incredulity as to the statement, over which they
made much sport and ridicule.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144"
id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> They said if the stars were inhabited,
the people would drop out, and hence they knew that this was a lie.
I found the months and years in which I had been kept in school, not
altogether useless in answering their questions. I told them that the
earth turned round every twenty-four hours, and also of its traveling
about the sun every year. Upon this they said we were just like all the
Americanos, big liars, and seemed to think that our parents had begun
young with us to learn us so perfectly the art of falsehood so early.
But still we could see, through all their accusations of falsehood, by
their astonishment, and discussion, and arguments upon the matter of
our conversation, they were not wholly unbelieving. They would tell us,
however, that an &#8216;evil spirit&#8217; reigned among the whites,
and that he was leading them on to destruction. They seemed sincere
in their belief that there were scarcely any of the whites that could
be trusted, but that they had evil assistance, which made them great
and powerful. As to any system of religion or morality, they seemed
to be beneath it. But we found, though the daily tasks upon us were
not abated, yet our condition was greatly mollified; and we had become
objects of their growing curiosity, mere playthings, over which they
could make merry.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are much given to humor and fun, but it generally
descends to low obscenity and meanness. They had great contempt for
one that would complain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145"
id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> under torture or suffering, even though
of their own tribe, and said a person that could not uncomplainingly
endure suffering was not fit to live. They asked us if we wanted to get
away, and tried by every stratagem to extort from us our feelings as to
our captivity; but we were not long in learning that any expression of
discontent was the signal for new toils, and tasks, and grievances. We
made the resolution between us to avoid any expression of discontent,
which, at times, it cost us no small effort to keep.</p>

<p>&#8220;We learned that this tribe was a detached parcel of the old
and more numerous tribe bearing their name, and whose locality was in
the regions of New-Mexico. They had become in years gone, impatient
of the restraint put upon them by the Catholic missionaries, and had
resolved upon emancipation from their control, and had accordingly
sought a home in the wild fastnesses of these northern mountains.
The old tribe had since given them the name of the &#8216;Touto
Apaches,&#8217; an appellation signifying their unruliness, as well as
their roving and piratical habits. They said that the old tribe was
much more wicked than themselves, and that they would be destroyed by
the whites.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyond the manuscript touching the geography and appearance of the
country where the scenes of this book were laid, and which was prepared
for previous editions, there is considerable concerning the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
peculiar superstitions and crude beliefs of these Indians, as well
as upon histories treasured up by them touching their tribes and
individual members of them, which we believe would be read with
interest, but scarcely a tithe of which can we give without swelling
this book beyond all due bounds. Of these histories it is not to be
supposed that more than mere scraps could have been gleaned by Olive,
when we remember her age, and that all that is remembered is from mere
verbal recital.</p>

<p>The Indians would congregate on evenings set apart, when one of
their number, most in years and of prominent position, would entertain
the company with a narration, frequently long and tedious, of the
adventures of his youthful days. On one of these occasions an old
Indian spoke as follows: &#8220;I am the son of an Indian who was chief
of the Camanche tribe. I had heard often of the white people. I longed
to see one. I was told by my father one day that I might, with some of
the warriors of the tribe, go on a hunt to the north, and also that we
would probably find some white people; if so, that we must kill them,
and bring in their scalps with any white captive girls if we could find
them. We had so many (counting his fingers up to three) bows and so
many (forty-eight) arrows each.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most of my desire was to see and kill a white man, and
take some captives. We traveled a very long way. We passed through
several tribes of Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147"
id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> We found, according to the accounts of
some Indians away to the north, that there were white people near them,
but that we must not touch them; that they were friendly and traded
with themselves; that some of their squaws were married to them; that
they (the whites) came from the great <i>Auhah</i> (sea) to the setting sun.
One day, about dark, we came in view of an object that we thought at
first to be a bear. We soon found it was a man. We waited and skulked
for some time to find out, if possible, whether it was a man, and how
many of them there were. We stayed all night in this condition, and it
was very cold. Just before fair day, we moved slowly round the place
where we had seen the object. As we thought we had got past it and
not espied anything, we concluded to go on, when we were suddenly met
by a huge-looking thing with a covering (skin) such as we had never
before seen. We were surprised and did not know what to do. It was
partly behind a rock, and we were too much scared to draw our bows.
After a word together, (there were four of us,) we concluded to run.
So we started. We had not gone far when an Indian jumped out after us,
threw an <i>umsupieque</i> (white blanket) from his head, and called to us
to stop. We had never seen this umsupieque before. We were very much
ashamed. We thought at first, and when we ran, that some of our friends
had been killed and had come (or their ghosts) to meet us.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> The
Indian, a Chimowanan, came up to us, and began to laugh at our bravery!
We were much ashamed, but we could not help it now. We left the Indian,
after making him promise that he would not tell of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we had traveled one day, with no game or anything to
eat, we came to a small house built of wood. We thought it the house of
a white man. We skulked in the bushes, and thought we would watch it
until they should come out, or, if away, come home. We waited one day
and two nights, eating nothing but a few roots. We saw no one, so we
set fire to the house and went on. We were more afraid of the Indians
than the whites, for they had said they would kill us if we touched
the whites. A few days after this we saw another house; we watched
that a long time, then burned it, and started for home. This is all we
did. When we came home our tribe turned out to see us, and hear of our
war-hunt. We had but little to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next year, the Indian who had scared us with the white
blanket, came among us. I saw him, and made him promise not to tell
my father what a coward I had shown myself when I met him; but I
soon found that all the tribe knew all about it. When the tribe were
gathered together one day for a dance, they laughed at me and about me
for my running from the Indian. I found that the Indian had told some
of the tribe, and they had told my father.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> My father joined with
the rest in making fun of me for it. I blamed him, and felt mad enough
to kill him. He found it out, so, just before we separated, he called
them all together, and told them that he had displeased his son by
what he had said of me, and now he wanted to make it all right. He
said, just before he sat down, that if ever they should be attacked,
he should feel that they were safe, that he knew his son and those
who went north to kill white people would be safe, for they had shown
themselves good at running. This maddened me more than ever, and up to
this day I have not heard the last of my running from the Indian. I am
now old, my head is nearly bald, the hairs that have fallen from my
head have grown up to be some of these I now see about me. I shall soon
go to yonder hill. I want you to burn my bow and arrow with my body, so
that I can hunt up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Toutos&#8217; had, however, for a long time
occupied their present position, and almost the only tribe with whom
they had any intercourse was the Mohaves, (Mo-ha-vays,) a tribe
numbering about twelve hundred, and located three hundred miles to the
northwest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were many, however, who had come from other and
different tribes. Some from the north, some from the south and
southwest. Hence there was a marked distinction among their
features and appearance. It seemed from what we could learn<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> that
this Touton tribe, or secession fragment, had from their villainous
propensities fled to this hiding-place, and since their separation
been joined by scattered members and stray families from other tribes,
persons whom Touton bands had fallen in with during their depredating
trips abroad, and who from community of feeling and life had thus
amalgamated together.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a few years constant traffic had been kept up between
the Mohaves and Toutons. The Mohaves made an expedition once a year,
sometimes oftener, to the Apaches, in small companies, bringing with
them vegetables, grain, and the various products of their soil, which
they would exchange with the Apaches for fur, skins of animals, and
all of the few articles that their different mode of life furnished.
During the autumn of 1851, late in the season, quite a large company
of Mohaves came among us on a trading expedition. But the whole
transactions of one of these expeditions did not comprise the amount
of wealth or business of one hour&#8217;s ordinary shopping of a
country girl. This was the first acquaintance we had with those
superior Indians. During their stay we had some faint hints that it
was meditated to sell us to the Mohaves in exchange for vegetables,
which they no doubt regarded as more useful for immediate consumption
than their captives. But still it was only a hint that had been given
us, and the curiosity and anxiety it created soon vanished,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> and
we sank again into the daily drudging routine of our dark prison life.
Months rolled by, finding us early and late at our burden-bearing and
torturing labors, plying hands and feet to heed the demands of our lazy
lords, and the taunts and exactions of a swarm of heathen urchins,
sometimes set over us. But since the coming of these Mohaves a new
question had been presented, and a new source of anxious solicitude
had been opened. Hours at a time were spent apart, dwelling upon
and conversing about the possibilities and probabilities, with all
the gravity of men in the council of state, of our being sold to
another tribe, and what might be its effects upon us. At times it
was considered as the possible means by which an utter and hopeless
bondage might be sealed upon us for life. It was seen plainly that the
love of traffic predominated among these barbarous hordes; that the
lives of their captives would be but a small weight in the balance, if
they interfered with their lust of war or conquest, if gain without
toil might be gratified. It was feared that the deep-seated hostility
which they bore to the white race, the contempt which they manifested
to their captives, united with the fear (which their conduct had more
than once exhibited) that they might be left without that constant,
vigilant oversight that was so great a tax upon their indolence to
maintain over them, that they might return to their own people and tell
the tale of their sufferings and captivity,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> and thus bring down
upon them the vengeance of the whites; that all these causes might
induce them to sell their captives to the most inaccessible tribe, and
thus consign them to a captivity upon which the light of hope or the
prospect of escape could not shine.&#8221;</p>

<p>On a little mound, a short distance from the clustered, smoking
wigwams, constituting the Apache village, on a pleasant day, see these
two captive girls, their root baskets laid aside, and side by side
upon the ground, sitting down to a few moments&#8217; conversation.
They talk of the year that has now nearly closed, the first of their
captivity, the bitterness that had mingled in the cup of its allotment,
of their dead, who had now slept one year of their last sleep, and with
much concern they are now querying about what might be the intentions
of the Mohaves in their daily expected coming again so soon among the
Apaches.</p>

<p>Mary Ann says: &#8220;I believe they will sell us; I overheard
one of the chiefs say something the other day in his wigwam, about
our going among the Mohaves, and it was with some words about their
expected return. I do not know, but from what I saw of them I think
they know more, and live better than these miserable Apaches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive. &#8220;But may be they put on the best side when here, they
might treat us worse than the Apaches.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153"
id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>M. A. &#8220;O, that will be impossible without they kill us, and
if we cannot escape, the sooner we die the better. I wish, Olive, you
would agree to it, and we will start to-night and try to make our
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>O. &#8220;But where shall we go? We know not the way we came, much
of it was traveled in the night, besides this, these Indians have
their trails well known to them, leading through all these mountains,
and we could not get upon one where they would not be sure to head
us, and you know they say they have spies continually out to let the
tribe know when any of their enemies come into the vicinity of their
village.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. A. &#8220;Well, Olive, how often have you told me that were it
not for a very faint hope you have of getting away, and your concern
for me, you would rather die than live. And you know we both think they
intend to sell us, and if they sell us to these Mohaves we will have
to travel three hundred miles, and I can never live through it. I have
a severe cough now, and almost every night I take more cold. Ma always
said &#8216;her Mary Ann would die with consumption,&#8217; but she did
not think, I guess, of such a consumption as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor girl,&#8221; thought Olive, half aloud, &#8220;how
her eyes glisten, how her cheeks every day become more spare and
pale, and her black, flashing eye is sinking into her head.&#8221;
Olive turned her head carelessly, wiped the tear from her eye,
and looking again in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> the upturned face of her sister, said:
&#8220;Why, Mary, if you are afraid that you would perish in traveling
to the Mohave country, how could you stand the roving day and night
among the hills, and we should be obliged, you know, to travel away
from the trail for a week, perhaps a month, living on roots?&#8221;</p>

<p>M. A. &#8220;As for roots, they are about all we get now, and I had
rather live on them in trying to get away than in staying here, or
being driven like oxen again three hundred miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the little pale face of her sister kindled with such an
enthusiasm that Olive could hardly avoid expressing the effect it had
upon her own mind. Mary was about to continue when her sister, seeing
an Indian near them, bade her hush, and they were about to renew their
work when Mary said: &#8220;Look! who are those? they are Indians, they
are those very Mohaves! See! they have a horse, and there is a squaw
among them.&#8221;</p>

  </a>
</div>

<p>The Indian, who was approaching them, had by this time caught a
view of them, and was running to camp to spread the news. &#8220;I
had,&#8221; says the older, &#8220;now no doubt that the approaching
company were Mohaves, and I was half inclined to improve the excitement
and carelessness that would prevail for a while after their coming
among us, to slip away, taking good care to make sure of a piece of
meat, a few roots, and something to kill myself with if I should
find myself about falling into the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> pursuers. But in
more sober moments we thought it well that this fear of being
again caught, and of torture they would be sure to inflict, if we
should be unsuccessful, kept us from such a desperate step. The
Mohave party are now descending a slope to the Apache village, and
roaring, yelling, and dancing prevail through the gathering crowd of
Apaches. The party consisted of five men, and a young woman under
twenty years. It was not long ere two of the chiefs came to us, and
told us that these Mohaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> had come after us, according to a
contract made with them at a previous visit; that the party had been
back to obtain the sanction of Espaniole, the Mohave chief, to the
contract, and that now the chief had sent his own daughter to witness
to his desire to purchase the white captives. The chief had, however,
left it with his daughter to approve or annul the contract that had
been made.&#8221;</p>

<p>This daughter of the chief was a beautiful, mild, and sympathizing
woman. Her conduct and behavior toward these Apache captives bespoke
a tutoring, and intelligence, and sweetness of disposition that won
their interest at once. She could use the Apache language with fluency,
and was thus enabled to talk with the captives for whom she had come.
She told her designs to them, and had soon settled it in her mind to
approve the contract previously made.</p>

<p>During that evening there was much disquiet and misrule throughout
the village. The agitated and interested captives, though having
been informed that all the negotiations had been completed for their
transfer, were much perplexed to learn the reasons of the excitement
still raging.</p>

<p>There was a studied effort, which was plainly perceived by them, to
cover the matter of the councils and heated debates, which occupied
the whole night from them; but, by remarks which reached them from
different ones, they learned that their destiny was in a very critical
suspense. There was a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157"
id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> party who were angrily opposed to the
acceptance of the Mohave propositions, among whom were the murderers of
the Oatman family.</p>

<p>Different ones sought by every possible means to draw out the
feelings of their captives to the proposed removal. One in particular,
a young Indian woman, who had forced a disagreeable intimacy with
Olive, sought to make her say that she would rather go to the Mohaves.
The discretion of the captive girl, however, proved equal to the
treachery of the Indian mistress, and no words of complaint, or
expressions of desire, could the latter glean to make a perverted
report of at head-quarters. The artful Miss To-aquin had endeavored
from the first, under friendly pretenses, to acquaint herself with the
American language, and succeeded in acquiring a smattering of it. But
her eaves-dropping propensities had made the intended victims of her
treachery wary, since they had known, in several instances, of her
false reports and tale-bearings to the chief.</p>

<p>While sitting alone by a small fire in their wigwam, late in the
night, this Jezebel came and seated herself by them, and with her
smiles and rattling tongue, feigning an anxious interest in their
welfare, said, in substance:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are glad you are going to the Mohaves? But I
always hated them; they will steal, and lie, and cheat. Do you think
you will get away? I suppose you do. But these miserable Mohaves<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> are
going to sell you to another tribe; if they do not, it will not be long
ere they will kill you. O, I am very sad because you are going away! I
hoped to see you free in a short time; but I know you will never get
back to the whites now. Suppose you will try, will you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive replied: &#8220;We are captives, and since our parents and all
our kindred are dead, it matters little where we are, there or here. We
are treated better than we deserve, perhaps; and we shall try to behave
well, let them treat us as they may; and as to getting away, you know
it would be impossible and foolish for us to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Mohave party professed that it was out of kindness to us
that they had come to take us with them; that they knew of the cruel
treatment we were suffering among the Apaches, and intended to use us
well.</p>

<p>&#8220;This would all have been very comforting to us, and it was
only to us they made this plea, had we been prepared to give them
credit for the absence of that treachery which had been found, so far,
as natural to an Indian as his breath. But their natures do not grow
sincerity, and their words are to have no weight in judging of their
characters. To us it was only gloom that lay upon our way, whether to
the Mohaves or to stay in our present position. Their real design it
was useless to seek to read until its execution came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159"
id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Sunrise, which greeted us ere we had a moment&#8217;s sleep,
found the party prepared to leave, and we were coolly informed by our
captors that we must go with them. Two horses, a few vegetables, a few
pounds of beads, and three blankets we found to be our price in that
market.</p>

<p>&#8220;We found that there were those among the Apaches who were
ready to tear us in pieces when we left, and they only wanted a few
more to unite with them, to put an end to our lives at once. They now
broke forth in the most insulting language to us, and to the remainder
of the tribe for bargaining us away. Some laughed, a few among the
children, who had received a care and attention from us denied by
their natural parents, cried, and a general pow-wow rent the air as we
started upon another three hundred miles&#8217; trip.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">&#8220;We</span> were informed
at the outset that we had three hundred and fifty miles before us,
and all to be made on foot. Our route we soon found to be in no way
preferable to the one by which the Apache village had been reached.
It was now about the first day of March, 1852. One year had been
spent by us in a condition the most abject, the most desolate, with
treatment the most cruel that barbarity and hate could invent, and
this all endured without the privilege of a word from ourselves to
turn the scale in this direction or that, in a rugged, rocky country,
filled with bare mountains or lesser hills with slight vegetation,
and that tame and tasteless, or irregular piles of boulders and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
gravel beds; we were now being hurried on under Indian guardianship
alone, we knew not where nor for what purpose. We had not proceeded far
ere it was painfully impressed upon our feet, if not our aching hearts,
that this trail to a second captivity was no improvement on the first,
whatever might be the fate awaiting us at its termination. We had been
under tutorage for one whole year in burden bearing, and labor even
beyond our strength, but a long walk or run, as this proved, we had not
been driven to during that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Ann, poor girl, entered upon this trip with less
strength or fortitude to encounter its hardships than the one before.
She had not proceeded far before I saw plainly that she would not be
able to stand it long. With the many appearances of kindness that our
present overseers put on, yet they seemed to be utterly destitute of
any heart or will to enter into the feelings of those who had been
brought up more delicately than themselves, or to understand their
inability to perform the task dictated by their rough and hardy habits.
Our feet soon became sore, and we were unable, on the second day after
about noon, to keep up with their rapid pace. A small piece of meat was
put into our hands on starting, and this with the roots we were allowed
to dig, and these but few, was our sole subsistence for ten days.</p>

<p>&#8220;With much complaining, and some threatening from our
recent captors, we were allowed to rest on<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> the second day a short
time. After this we were not compelled to go more than thirty-five
miles any one day, and pieces of skins were furnished for our feet, but
not until they had been needlessly bruised and mangled without them.
The nights were cool, and, contrary to our expectations, the daughter
of the chief showed us kindness throughout the journey by sharing her
blankets with us at each camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all rough, uncouth, irregular, and unattractive countries
through which human beings trail, the one through which that ten
days&#8217; march led us, must remain unsurpassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the eleventh day, about two hours before sunset, we made
a bold steep ascent (and of such we had been permitted to climb many)
from which we had an extensive view on either side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before us, commencing a little from the foot of our
declivity, lay a narrow valley covered with a carpet of green,
stretching a distance, seemingly, of twenty miles. On either side were
the high, irregularly sloped mountains, with their foot hills robed in
the same bright green as the valley, and with their bald humpbacks and
sharp peaks, treeless, verdureless, and desolate, as if the tempests of
ages had poured their rage upon their sides and summits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our guides soon halted. We immediately observed by
their movements and manifestations that some object beyond
the loveliness that nature had strewn upon that valley, was
enrapturing their gaze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163"
id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> We had stood gazing a few moments only,
when the smoke at the distance of a few miles, winding in gentle
columns up the ridges, spoke to us of the abodes or tarrying of human
beings. Very soon there came into the field of our steady view a large
number of huts, clothing the valley in every direction. We could
plainly see a large cluster of these huts huddled into a nook in the
hills on our right and on the bank of a river, whose glassy waters
threw the sunlight in our face; its winding, zigzag course pointed out
to us by the row of beautiful cottonwood trees that thickly studded its
vicinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here, Olive,&#8217; said Mary Ann, &#8216;is the place
where they live. O isn&#8217;t it a beautiful valley? It seems to me I
should like to live here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;May be,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that you will not want
to go back to the whites any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;O yes, there is green grass and fine meadows there,
besides good people to care for us; these savages are enough to make
any place look ugly, after a little time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were soon ushered into the &#8216;Mohave Valley,&#8217;
and had not proceeded far before we began to pass the low, rude huts of
the Mohave settlers. They greeted us with shouts, and dance, and song
as we passed. Our guides kept up, however, a steady unheeding march for
the village, occasionally joined by fierce, filthy-looking Mohaves,
and their more filthy-looking children, who would come up, look<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
rudely in our faces, fasten their deep-set, small, flashing eyes upon
us, and trip along, with merry-making, hallooing, and dancing at our
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were conducted immediately to the home of the chief, and
welcomed with the staring eyes of collecting groups, and an occasional
smile from the members of the chief&#8217;s family, who gave the
warmest expressions of joy over the return of their daughter and sister
so long absent. Seldom does our civilization furnish a more hearty
exhibition of affection for kindred, than welcomed the coming in of
this member of the chief&#8217;s family, though she had been absent
but a few days. The chief&#8217;s house was on a beautiful but small
elevation crowning the river bank, from which the eye could sweep a
large section of the valley, and survey the entire village, a portion
of which lined each bank of the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a model, and one that will give a correct idea of the
form observed, especially in their village structures, we may speak of
the chief&#8217;s residence. When we reached the outskirts of the town
we observed upon the bank of the river a row of beautiful cottonwood
trees, just putting out their new leaves and foliage, their branches
interlocking, standing in a row, about a perfect square of about one
hundred feet, and arranged in taste. They were thrifty, and seemed fed
from a rich soil, and with other plots covered with the same growths,
and abounding throughout the village, presented truly an oasis in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the general desert of country upon which we had been trailing our
painful walk for the last ten days, climbing and descending, with
unshapen rocks, and sharp gravel, and burning sands for our pavement.
Immediately behind the row of trees first spoken of, was a row of poles
or logs, each about six inches in diameter and standing close to each
other, one end firmly set in the ground and reaching up about twenty
feet, forming an inclosure of about fifty feet square.</p>

<p>&#8220;We entered this inclosure through a door, (never shut,) and
found a tidy yard, grass-plotted. Inside of this was still another
inclosure of about twenty feet, walled by the same kind of fence, only
about one third as high. Running from front to rear, and dividing this
dwelling-place of the Mohave magnate into equal parts, stood a row of
these logs stuck in the ground, and running up about three feet above
the level top of the outside row, and forming a ridge for the resting
of the roof. The roof was a thick mat of limbs and mud. A few blankets,
a small smoking fire near the door, with naked walls over which the
finishing hand of the upholsterer had never passed, a floor made when
all <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> was created, welcomed us to the interior.</p>

<p>&#8220;The daughter of the chief had been kind to us, if kindness
could be shown under their barbarous habits and those rates of travel
while on our way. She was more intelligent and seemed capable of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
more true sympathy and affection, than any we had yet met in our one
year&#8217;s exile. She was of about seventeen years, sprightly,
jovial, and good-natured, and at times manifested a deep sympathy for
us, and a commiseration of our desolate condition. But though she was
daughter of the chief, their habits of barbarousness could not bend to
courtesy even toward those of rank. She had walked the whole distance
to the Apaches, carrying a roll of blankets, while two horses were rode
by two stalwart, healthy Mohaves by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;On entering the house Topeka, who had accompanied us, gave
an immediate and practical evidence that her stinted stomach had
not become utterly deaf to all the demands of hunger. Seeing a cake
roasting in the ashes, she seized it, and dividing it into three parts,
she gave me the Benjamin portion and bade us eat, which was done with
greediness and pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Night came on and with it the gathering of a large concourse
of Indians, their brown, stout wives and daughters, and swarms of
little ones whose faces and bare limbs would have suggested anything
else sooner than the near vicinity of clear water, or their knowledge
of its use for purifying purposes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians were mostly tall, stout, with large heads,
broad faces, and of a much more intelligent appearance than the
Apaches. Bark-clad, where clad at all, the scarcity of their
covering indicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167"
id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> either a warm climate or a great
destitution of the clothing material, or something else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their conduct during that night of wild excitement, was
very different from that by which our coming among the Apaches was
celebrated. That was one of selfish iron-hearted fiends, glutting over
a murderous, barbarous deed of death and plunder; this was that of a
company of indolent, superstitious, and lazy heathen, adopting the
only method which their darkness and ignorance would allow to signify
their joy over the return of kindred and the delighted purchase of two
foreign captives. They placed us out upon the green, and in the light
of a large, brisk fire, and kept up their dancing, singing, jumping,
and shouting, until near the break of day.</p>

<p>&#8220;After they had dispersed, and that night of tears, and the
bitterest emotions, and most torturing remembrances of the past,
and reflections of our present had nearly worn away, with bleeding
feet, worn in places almost to the bone, with aching limbs, beneath a
thin covering, side by side, little Mary Ann and myself lay us down
upon a sand bed to meditate upon sleep. A few hours were spent in
conversation, conducted in a low whisper, with occasional moments of
partial drowsiness, haunted with wild, frantic dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though five years separate that time and the present, where is
the heart but throbs sensitive to the dark, prison-like condition
of these two girls. Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168"
id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> at their situation, the scenes around;
having reached a strange tribe by a toilsome, painful ten days&#8217;
journey, the sufferings of which were almost insupportable and
life consuming, having been for nearly the whole night of their
introduction to a new captivity made the subjects of shouting and
confusion, heathenish, indelicate, and indecent, and toward morning
hiding themselves under a scanty covering, surrounded by unknown
savages; whispering into each other&#8217;s ears the hopes, fears, and
impressions of their new condition. Coveting sleep, but every touch
of its soft hand upon their moistened eyelids turned to torture and
hideousness by scary visions and dreams; harassed in mind over the
uncertainty and doubt haunting their imaginations, as to the probable
purposes of their new possessors in all their painstaking to secure a
transfer of the captives to them. It is true that less of barbarity had
marked the few days of their dependence upon their new owners, than
their Apache hardships; but they had sadly learned already that under
friendly guises their possible treachery might be wrapping and nursing
some foul and murderous design.</p>

<p>Plunged now into the depths of a wild country, where the traces of
a white foot would be sought in vain for hundreds of miles, and at
such a distance from the nearest route of the hurrying emigrant, as to
preclude almost the traveling of hope to their exile and gloom; it is
no marvel that these few hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169"
id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> allotted to sleep at the latter part
of the night, were disturbed by such questions as these: Why have
they purchased us? What labor or service do they intend subjecting
us to? Have they connived with our former masters to remove us still
further from the habitations of our countrymen, and sought to plunge
us so deep in these mountain defiles, that they may solace themselves
with that insatiate revenge upon our race which will encounter any
hardship rather than allow us the happiness of a return to our native
land? No marvel that they could not drive away such thoughts, though a
lacerated body was praying for balmy sleep, &#8220;nature&#8217;s sweet
restorer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Ann, the youngest, a little girl of eight years, had been
declining in health and strength for some time. She had almost starved
on that long road, kept up principally by a small piece of meat. For
over three hundred miles had she come, climbing rocks, traversing
sun-burned gravel and sand, marking the way by bleeding feet, sighs,
and piteous moanings; well-nigh breaking the heart of her older sister,
whose deepest anguish was the witnessing of these sufferings that she
could not relieve. She was not inclined to complain; nay, she was
given to a patient reserve that would bear her grief alone, sooner
than trouble her loved sister with it. She had from infancy been the
favorite child of the family; the only one of a frail constitution,
quickest to learn, and best to remember; and often, when at<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> home,
and the subject of disease and pain, exhibiting a meekness, judgment,
and fortitude beyond her years. She was tenderly loved by the whole
family; nursed by her fond mother with a delicacy and concern bestowed
on none of the rest; and now bound to the heart of her only sister by a
tie strengthened by mutual sufferings, and that made her every woe and
sigh a dagger to the heart of Olive. No marvel that the latter should
say: &#8220;Poor girl, I love her tenderly, ardently; and now to see
her driven forth whole days, with declining health, at a pace kept up
by these able-bodied Indians; to see her climb rugged cliffs, at times
upon her hands and knees, struggling up where others could walk, the
sweat coursing down freely from her pearly-white forehead; to hear her
heave those half-suppressed sighs; to see the steps of those little
bleeding feet totter and falter; to see the big tears standing out of
her eyes, glistening as if in the borrowed light of a purer home; to
see her turn at times and bury her head in some of the tattered furs
wrapped about a part of her person, and weeping alone, and then come
to me, saying: &#8216;How far, dear Olive, must we yet go?&#8217; To
hear her ask, and ask in vain, for bread, for meat, for water, for
something to eat, when nothing but their laziness denied her request;
these were sights and scenes I pray God to deliver me from in future! O
that I could blot out the impression they have indelibly written upon
my mind!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171"
id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But we are now here, and must make the best of
it,&#8217; was the interruption made the next morning to memories and
thoughts like the above. We were narrowly watched, and with an eye
and jealousy that seemed to indicate some design beyond and unlike
the one that was avowed to move them to purchase us, and to shut out
all knowledge of the way back to our race. We found the location and
scenery of our new home much pleasanter than the one last occupied. The
valley extended about thirty or forty miles, northeast by southwest,
and varying from two to five miles in width. Through its whole length
flowed the beautiful Colorado, in places a rapid, leaping stream,
in others making its way quietly, noiselessly over a deeper bed. It
varied, like all streams whose sources are in immediate mountains, in
depth, at different seasons of the year. During the melting of the
snows that clothed the mountain-tops to the north, when we came among
the Mohaves, it came roaring and thundering along its rock-bound banks,
threatening the whole valley, and doing some damage.</p>

<p>&#8220;We found the Mohaves accustomed to the tillage of the soil
to a limited extent, and in a peculiar way. And it was a season of
great rejoicing when the Colorado overflowed, as it was only after
overflows that they could rely upon their soil for a crop. In the
autumn they planted the wheat carefully in hills with their fingers,
and in the spring they planted corn,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> melons, and a few
garden vegetables. They had, however, but a few notions, and these
were crude, about agriculture. They were utterly without skill or art
in any useful calling. When we first arrived among them the wheat sown
the previous fall had come up, and looked green and thrifty, though it
did not appear, nor was it, sufficient to maintain one-fifth of their
population. They spent more time in raising twenty spears of wheat
from one hill, than was necessary to have cultivated one acre, with
the improvements they might and should have learned in the method of
doing it. It was to us, however, an enlivening sight to see even these
scattered parcels of grain growing, clothing sections of their valley.
It was a remembrancer, and reminded us of home, (now no more ours,) and
placed us in a nearness to the customs of a civilized mode of life that
we had not realized before.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a time after coming among them but little was said to
us; none seemed desirous to enter into any intercourse, or inquire
even, if it had been possible for us to understand them, as to our
welfare, past or present. Topeka gave us to know that we were to remain
in their house. Indeed we were merely regarded as strange intruders,
with whom they had no sympathy, and their bearing for a while toward
us seemed to say: &#8216;You may live here if you can eke out an
existence, by bowing yourselves unmurmuringly to our barbarism and
privations.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173"
id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;In a few days they began to direct us to work in various
ways, such as bringing wood and water, and to perform various errands
of convenience to them. Why they took the course they did I have never
been able to imagine; but it was only by degrees that their exactions
were enforced. We soon learned, however, that our condition was that of
unmitigated slavery, not to the adults merely, but to the children. In
this respect it was very much as among the Apaches. Their whimpering,
idiotic children, of not half a dozen years, very soon learned to drive
us about with all the authority of an Eastern lord. And these filthy
creatures would go in quest of occasions, seemingly to gratify their
love of command; and any want of hurried attention to them was visited
upon us by punishment, either by whipping or the withholding of our
food. Besides, the adults of the tribe enjoyed the sport of seeing us
thus forced into submission to their children.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Colorado had overflown during the winter, and there
had been considerable rain. The Mohaves were in high hopes for a
bountiful crop during this season. What was to them a rich harvest
would be considered in Yankee land, or in the Western states, a poor
compensation for so much time and plodding labor. For two years before
they had raised but little. Had the industry and skill of the least
informed of our agriculturists been applied to this Mohave valley,
it might have been made as productive<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> and fruitful a spot
as any I ever saw. But they were indolent and lazy, so that it would
seem impossible for ingenuity to invent modes by which they might work
to a greater disadvantage, or waste the little of strength they did
use. While their lot had cast them into the midst of superior natural
advantages, which ought to have awakened their pride and ambition to do
something for themselves, yet they were indisposed to every fatiguing
toil, unless in the chase or war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing during the summer of 1852 occurred to throw any light upon
that one question, to these captive girls the all-absorbing one,
one which, like an everywhere present spirit, haunted them day and
night, as to the probabilities of their ever escaping from Indian
captivity. It was not long before their language, of few words, was
so far understood as to make it easy to understand the Mohaves in
conversation. Every day brought to their ears expressions, casually
dropped, showing their spite and hate to the white race. They would
question their captives closely, seeking to draw from them any
discontent they might feel in their present condition. They taunted
them, in a less ferocious manner than the Apaches, but with every
evidence of an equal hate, about the good-for-nothing whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;At times, when some of their friends were visiting in
the neighborhood of our valley, they would call for the captives
that they might see them. One day, while one of the sub-chiefs and
his family were visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"
id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> at Espaniola&#8217;s house, Mary and
I were out a little from the house singing, and were overheard. This
aroused their curiosity, and we were called, and many questions were
put to us as to what we were singing, where we learned to sing,
and if the whites were good singers. Mary and I, at their request,
sang them some of our Sabbath-school hymns, and some of the short
children&#8217;s songs we had learned. After this we were teased very
much to sing to them. Several times a small string of beads was made
up among them and presented to us for singing to them for two or three
hours; also pieces of red flannel, (an article that to them was the
most valuable of any they could possess,) of which after some time we
had several pieces. These we managed to attach together with ravelings,
and wore them upon our persons. The beads we wore about our necks,
squaw fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of them were anxious to learn the language of the whites; among
these one Ccearekae, a young man of some self-conceit and pride. He
asked the elder of the girls, &#8220;How do you like living with the
Mohaves?&#8221; To which she replied, &#8220;I do not like it so well
as among the whites, for we do not have enough to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ccearekae. &#8220;We have enough to satisfy us; you Americanos (a
term also by them learned of the Mexicans) work hard, and it does you
no good; we enjoy ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176"
id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive. &#8220;Well, we enjoy ourselves well at home, and all our
white people seem happier than any Indian I have seen since.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ccearekae. &#8220;Our great fathers worked just as you whites do,
and they had many nice things to wear; but the flood came and swept the
old folks away, and a white son of the family stole all the arts, with
the clothing, etc., and the Mohaves have had none since.&#8221;</p>

<p>Olive. &#8220;But if our people had this beautiful valley they would
till it, and raise much grain. You Mohaves don&#8217;t like to work,
and you say you do not have enough to eat; then it is because you are
lazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At this his wrath was aroused, and with angry words and
countenance he left. I frequently told them how grain, and cattle,
and fowls would abound, if such good land was under the control of
the whites. This would sometimes kindle their wrath, and flirts, and
taunts, and again at other times their curiosity. One day several of
them were gathered, and questioning about our former homes, and the
white nation, and the way by which a living was made, etc. I told them
of plowing the soil. They then wanted to see the figure of a plow. I
accordingly, with sticks and marks in the sand, made as good a plow
as a girl of fifteen would be expected, perhaps, to make out of such
material; drew the oxen and hitched them to my plow, and told them
how it would break the soil. This feasted their curiosity a while,
but ended in a volley of scorn and mockery<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> to me and the race
of whites, and a general outburst of indignant taunts about their
meanness.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were very anxious to know how breaking up of the soil
would make grain grow; of what use it was; whether women labored in
raising grain. We told them of milking the cows, and how our white
people mowed the grass and fattened cattle, and many other things, to
which they gave the ear of a curiosity plainly beyond what they wanted
us to understand they cared about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told them of the abundance that rewards white labor, while
they had so little. They said: &#8216;Your ancestors were dishonest,
and their children are weak, and that by and by the pride and good
living of the present whites would ruin them. You whites,&#8217;
continued they, &#8216;have forsaken nature and want to possess the
earth, but you will not be able.&#8217; In thus conversing with them I
learned of a superstition they hold as to the origin of the distinction
existing among the red and white races.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was as follows: They said, pointing to a high mountain at
the northern end of the valley, (the highest in the vicinity,) there
was once a flood in ancient time that covered all the world but that
mountain, and all the present races then were merged in one family,
and this family was saved from the general deluge by getting upon that
mountain. They said that this antediluvian family was very large, and
had great riches, clothing, cattle, horses, and much to eat.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> They
said that after the water subsided one of the family took all the
cattle and our kind of clothing, and went north, was turned from red to
white, and so there settled. That another part of this family took deer
skins and bark, and from these the Indians came. They held that this
ancient family were all of red complexion until the progenitor of the
whites stole, then he was turned white. They said the Hiccos (dishonest
whites) would lose their cattle yet; that this thieving would turn
upon themselves. They said remains of the old &#8216;big house,&#8217;
in which this ancient family lived, were up there yet; also pieces
of bottles, broken dishes, and remnants of all the various kinds of
articles used by them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were told by them that this venerated spot had, ever
since the flood, been the abode of spirits; (Hippoweka, the name
for spirit;) and that these spirits were perfectly acquainted with
all the doings, and even the secret motives and character, of each
individual of the tribe. And also that it was a place consecrated to
these spirits, and if the feet of mortals should presume to tread
this enchanted spirit-land, a fire would burst from the mountain
and instantly consume them, except it be those who are selected and
appointed by these spirits to communicate some special message to the
tribe. This favored class were generally the physicians of the tribe.
And when a war project was designed by these master spirits, they
signified the bloody intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179"
id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> by causing the mountains to shoot forth
lurid tongues of fire, visible only to the revelators. All their war
plans and the time of their execution, their superstition taught them,
were communicated by the flame-lit pinnacle to those depositories
of the will of the spirits, and by them, under professed superhuman
dictation, the time, place, object, and method of the war were
communicated to the chief. Yet the power of the chief was absolute, and
when his <em>practical</em> wisdom suggested, these wizards always found a
license by a second consultation to modify the conflict, or change the
time and method of its operation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was their belief that in the region of this mountain there
was held in perpetual chains the spirit of every &#8216;Hicco&#8217;
that they had been successful in slaying; and that the souls of all
such were there eternally doomed to torment of the fiercest quenchless
fires, and the Mohave by whose hand the slaughter was perpetrated,
would be exalted to eternal honors and superior privileges therefor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was with strange emotions, after listening to this
superstitious tale, that our eyes rested upon that old bald peak, and
saw within the embrace of its internal fires, the spirits of many of
our own race, and thought of their being bound by this Mohave legend
to miseries so extreme, and woes so unmitigated, and a revenge so
insatiate.</p>

<p>&#8220;But according to their belief we could only<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
expect a like fate by attempting their rescue, and we did not care
enough for the professed validness of their faith to risk companionship
with them, even for the purpose of attempting to unbind the chains of
their tormenting bondage; and we turned away, most heartily pitying
them for their subjection to so gross a superstition, without any
particular concern for those who had been appointed by its authority
to its vengeance. We felt that if the Hiccos could manage to escape
all other hells, they could manage this one without our sympathy or
help.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was little game in the Mohave Valley, and of necessity
little meat was used by this tribe. At some seasons of the year, winter
and spring, they procure fish from a small lake in the vicinity. This
was a beautiful little body of water at freshet seasons, but in the
dry seasons became a loathsome mudhole. In their producing season, the
Mohaves scarcely raised a four months&#8217; supply, yet they might
have raised for the whole year as well. Often I thought, as I saw
garden vegetables and grain plucked ere they were grown, to be devoured
by these lazy &#8216;live to-day&#8217; savages, I should delight
to see the hand of the skillful agriculturist upon that beautiful
valley, with the Mohaves standing by to witness its capabilities for
producing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We spent most of this summer in hard work. We were, for
a long time, roused at the break of day, baskets were swung upon
our shoulders, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181"
id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> were obliged to go from six to eight
miles for the &#8216;Musquite,&#8217; a seed or berry growing upon a
bush about the size of our Manzanita. In the first part of the season,
this tree bloomed a beautiful flower, and after a few weeks a large
seed-bud could be gathered from it, and this furnished what is truly to
be called their staple article of subsistence. We spent from twilight
to twilight again, for a long time, in gathering this. And often we
found it impossible, from its scarcity that year, to fill our basket
in a day, as we were required; and for failing to do this we seldom
escaped a chastisement. This seed, when gathered, was hung up in their
huts to be thoroughly dried, and to be used when their vegetables
and grain should be exhausted. I could endure myself, the task daily
assigned me, but to see the demands and exactions made upon little
Mary Ann, day after day, by these unfeeling wretches, as many of them
were, when her constitution was already broken down, and she daily
suffering the most excruciating pains from the effects of barbarity she
had already received; this was a more severe trial than all I had to
perform of physical labor. And I often felt as though it would be a sad
relief to see her sink into the grave, beyond the touch and oppression
of the ills and cruel treatment she was subjected to. But there were
times when she would enliven after rest, which from her utter inability
they were obliged to grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182"
id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We were accused by our captors several times during this
season, of designing and having plotted already to make our escape.
Some of them would frequently question and annoy us much to discover,
if possible, our feelings and our intentions in reference to our
captivity. Though we persisted in denying any purpose to attempt our
escape, many of them seemed to disbelieve us, and would warn us against
any such undertaking, by assuring us they would follow us, if it were
necessary, quite to the white settlements, and would torment us in the
most painful manner, if we were ever to be recaptured.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day, while we were sitting in the hut of the chief,
having just returned from a root-digging excursion, there came two
of their physicians attended by the chief and several others, to the
door of the hut. The chief&#8217;s wife then bade us go out upon the
yard, and told us that the physicians were going to put marks on our
faces. It was with much difficulty that we could understand, however,
at first, what was their design. We soon, however, by the motions
accompanying the commands of the wife of the chief, came to understand
that they were going to tattoo our faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had seen them do this to some of their female children,
and we had often conversed with each other about expressing the
hope that we should be spared from receiving their marks upon us. I
ventured to plead with them for a few moments that they would<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> not
put those ugly marks upon our faces. But it was in vain. To all our
expostulations they only replied in substance that they knew why we
objected to it; that we expected to return to the whites, and we would
be ashamed of it then; but that it was their resolution we should
never return, and that as we belonged to them we should wear their
&#8216;Ki-e-chook.&#8217; They said further, that if we should get
away, and they should find us among other tribes, or if some other
tribes should steal us, they would by this means know us.</p>

<p>&#8220;They then pricked the skin in small regular rows on our chins
with a very sharp stick, until they bled freely. They then dipped these
same sticks in the juice of a certain weed that grew on the banks of
the river, and then in the powder of a blue stone that was to be found
in low water, in some places along the bed of the stream, (the stone
they first burned until it would pulverize easy, and in burning it
turned nearly black,) and pricked this fine powder into these lacerated
parts of the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The process was somewhat painful, though it pained us more
for two or three days after than at the time of its being done. They
told us this could never be taken from the face, and that they had
given us a different mark from the one worn by their own females, as we
saw, but the same with which they marked all their own captives, and
that they could claim us in whatever tribe they might find us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The autumn was by far the easiest portion of the year for
us. To multiply words would not give any clearer idea to the reader of
our condition. It was one continual routine of drudgery. Toward spring
their grains were exhausted. There was but little rain, not enough
to raise the Colorado near the top of its banks. The Mohaves became
very uneasy about their wheat in the ground. It came up much later
than usual, and looked sickly and grew tardily after it was out of
the ground. It gave a poor, wretched promise at the best for the next
year. Ere it was fairly up there were not provisions or articles of any
kind to eat in the village any one night to keep its population two
days. We found that the people numbered really over fifteen hundred.
We were now driven forth every morning by the first break of day, cold
and sometimes damp, with rough, bleak winds, to glean the old, dry
musquite seed that chanced to have escaped the fatiguing search of the
summer and autumn months. From this on to the time of gathering the
scanty harvest of that year, we were barely able to keep soul and body
together. And the return for all our vigorous labor was a little dry
seed in small quantities. And all this was put forth under the most
sickening apprehensions of a worse privation awaiting us the next year.
This harvest was next to nothing. No rain had fallen during the spring
to do much good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Above what was necessary for seeding again,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
there was not one month&#8217;s supply when harvest was over. We had
gathered less during the summer of &#8216;musquite,&#8217; and nothing
but starvation could be expected. This seemed to throw the sadness of
despair upon our condition, and to blot all our faint but fond hopes
of reaching our native land. We knew, or thought we knew, that in case
of an extremity our portion must be meted out after these voracious,
unfeeling idlers had supplied themselves. We had already seen that a
calamity or adversity had the effect to make these savages more savage
and implacable. I felt more keenly for Mary Ann than myself. She often
said (for we were already denied the larger half necessary to satisfy
our appetites) that she &#8216;could not live long without something
more to eat.&#8217; She would speak of the plenty that she had at home,
and that might now be there, and sometimes would rather chide me for
making no attempts to escape. &#8216;O, if I could only get one dish of
bread and milk,&#8217; she would frequently say, &#8216;I could enjoy
it so well!&#8217; They ground their seed between stones, and with
water made a mush, and we spent many mournful hours of conversation
over our gloomy state as we saw the supply of this tasteless,
nauseating &#8216;<em>musquite mush</em>&#8217; failing, and that the season
of our almost sole dependence upon it was yet but begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not unfrequent that a death occurred among them
by the neglect and laziness so characteristic of the Indian. One
day I was out gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186"
id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> chottatoe, when I was suddenly surprised
and frightened by running upon one of the victims of this stupid,
barbarous inhumanity. He was a tall, bony Indian of about thirty years.
His eye was rather sunken, his visage marred, as if he had passed
through extreme hardships. He was lying upon the ground, moaning and
rolling from side to side in agony the most acute and intense. I looked
upon him, and my heart was moved with pity. Little Mary said, &#8216;I
will go up and find out what ails him.&#8217; On inquiry we soon found
that he had been for some time ill, but not so as to become utterly
helpless. And not until one of their number is entirely disabled, do
they seem to manifest any feeling or concern for him. The physician
was called, and soon decided that he was not in the least diseased. He
told Mary that nothing ailed him save the want of food; said that he
had been unable for some time to procure his food; that his friends
devoured any that was brought into camp without dividing it with him;
that he had been gradually running down, and now he wanted to die. O
there was such dejection, such a forlorn, despairing look written upon
his countenance as made an impression upon my mind which is yet vivid
and mournful.</p>

<p>&#8220;He soon died, and then his father and all his relatives
commenced a hideous, barbarous howling and jumping, indicative
of the most poignant grief. Whether their sorrowing was a
matter of conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187"
id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> or bereavement, none could tell, but
it would improve my opinion of them to believe it originated with the
former.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such scenes were not far between, and yet these results of
their laziness and want of enterprise and humanity, when thickening
upon them, had no effect to beget a different policy or elevate them
to that life of happiness, thrift, and love which would have prolonged
their years, and removed the dismal, gloomy aspect of every-day life
among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were now put upon a stinted allowance, and the
restrictions upon us were next to the taking the life of Mary Ann.
During the second autumn, and at the time spoken of above, the
chief&#8217;s wife gave us some seed-grain, corn and wheat, showed
us about thirty feet square of ground marked off upon which we might
plant it and raise something for ourselves. We planted our wheat, and
carefully concealed the handful of corn and melon-seeds to plant in the
spring. This we enjoyed very much. It brought to our minds the extended
grain-fields that waved about our cottage in Illinois, of the beautiful
spring when winter&#8217;s ice and chill had departed before the breath
of a warmer season, of the May-mornings, when we had gone forth to
the plow-fields and followed barefooted in the new-turned furrow, and
of the many long days of grain-growing and ripening in which we had
watched the daily change in the fields of wheat and oats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188"
id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;These hours of plying our fingers (not sewing) in the ground
flew quickly by, but not without their tears and forebodings that
ere we could gather the results, famine might lay our bodies in the
dust. Indeed we could see no means by which we could possibly maintain
ourselves to harvest again. Winter, a season of sterility and frozen
nights, was fast approaching, and to add to my desolateness, I plainly
saw that grief, or want of food, or both, were slowly, and inch by
inch, enfeebling and wasting away Mary Ann.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians said that about sixty miles away there
was a &#8216;Taneta&#8217; (tree) that bore a berry called
&#8216;Oth-to-toa,&#8217; upon which they had subsisted for some time
several years before, but it could be reached only by a mountainous
and wretched way of sixty miles. Soon a large party made preparations
and set out in quest of this &#8216;life-preserver.&#8217; Many of
those accustomed to bear burdens were not able to go. Mary Ann started,
but soon gave out and returned. A few Indians accompanied us, but
it was a disgrace for them to bear burdens; this was befitting only
to squaws and captives. I was commanded to pick up my basket and go
with them, and it was only with much pleading I could get them to
spare my sister the undertaking when she gave out. I had borne that
&#8216;Chiechuck&#8217; empty and full over many hundred miles, but
never over so rugged a way, nor when it seemed so heavy as now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189"
id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We reached the place on the third day, and found the taneta
to be a bush, and very much resembling the musquite, only with a much
larger leaf. It grew to a height of from five to thirty feet. The berry
was much more pleasant to the taste than the musquite; the juice of it,
when extracted and mixed with water, was very much like the orange. The
tediousness and perils of this trip were very much enlivened with the
hope of getting something with which to nourish and prolong the life of
Mary. She was very much depressed, and appeared quite ill when I left
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;After wandering about for two days with but little gathered,
six of us started in quest of some place where the oth-to-toa might be
more abundant. We traveled over twenty miles away from our temporary
camp. We found tanetas in abundance, and loaded with the berry. We had
reached a field of them we judged never found before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our baskets being filled, we hastened to join the camp
party before they should start for the village. We soon lost our way,
the night being dark, and wandered without water the whole night,
and were nearly all sick from eating our oth-to-toa berry. Toward
day, nearly exhausted, and three of our number very sick, we were
compelled to halt. We watched over and nursed the sick, sweating
them with the medical leaf always kept with us, and about the only
medicine used by the Mohaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190"
id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> But our efforts were vain, for before
noon the three had breathed their last. A fire was kindled and their
bodies were burned; and for several hours I expected to be laid upon
one of those funeral pyres in that deep, dark, and almost trackless
wilderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I suffered more during those two or three hours in
mind and body than at any other period of my captivity in the same
time. We feared to stay only as long as was necessary, for our energies
were well-nigh exhausted. We started back, and I then saw an Indian
carry a basket. One of them took the baskets of the dead, and kept up
with us. The rest of our party went howling through the woods in the
most dismal manner. The next day we found the camp, and found we had
been nearly around it. We were soon on our way, and by traveling all
one night we were at the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be impossible to put upon paper any true idea of
my feelings and sufferings during this trip, on account of Mary. Had
it not been for her I could have consented to have laid down and
died with the three we buried. I did not then expect to get back. I
feared she would not live, and I found on reaching the village that
she had materially failed, and had been furnished with scarcely food
enough to keep her alive. I sought by every possible care to recruit
her, and for a short time she revived. The berry we had gathered,
while it would add to on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191"
id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>e&#8217;s flesh, and give an appearance
of healthiness, (if the stomach could bear it,) had but little
strengthening properties in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I traveled whole days together in search of the eggs of
blackbirds for Mary Ann. These eggs at seasons were plenty, but not
then. These she relished very much. I cherished for a short time the
hope that she might, by care and nursing, be kept up until spring, when
we could get fish. The little store we had brought in was soon greedily
devoured, and with the utmost difficulty could we get a morsel. The
ground was searched for miles, and every root that could nourish human
life was gathered. The Indians became reckless and quarrelsome, and
with unpardonable selfishness each would struggle for his own life in
utter disregard of his fellows. Mary Ann failed fast. She and I were
whole days at a time without anything to eat; when by some chance, or
the kindness of the chief&#8217;s daughter, we would get a morsel to
satisfy our cravings. Often would Mary say to me, &#8216;I am well
enough, but I want something to eat; then I should be well.&#8217; I
could not leave her over night. Roots there were none I could reach
by day and return; and when brought in, our lazy lords would take
them for their own children. Several children had died, and more
were in a dying state. Each death that occurred was the occasion of
a night or day of frantic howling and crocodile mourning. Mary was
weak and growing weaker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> and I gave up in despair. I sat by her
side for a few days, most of the time only begging of the passers-by
to give me something to keep Mary alive. Sometimes I succeeded. Had it
not been for the wife and daughter of the chief, we could have obtained
nothing. They seemed really to <em>feel</em> for us, and I have no doubt would
have done more if in their power. My sister would not complain, but beg
for something to eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;She would often think and speak in the most affectionate
manner of &#8216;dear pa and ma,&#8217; and with confidence she would
say, &#8216;they suffered an awful death, but they are now safe and
happy in a better and brighter land, though I am left to starve among
savages.&#8217; She seemed now to regard life no longer as worth
preserving, and she kept constantly repeating expressions of longing
to die and be removed from a gloomy captivity to a world where no tear
of sorrow dims the eye of innocence and beauty. She called me to her
side one day and said: &#8216;Olive, I shall die soon; you will live
and get away. Father and mother have got through with sufferings, and
are now at rest; I shall soon be with them and those dear brothers and
sisters.&#8217; She then asked me to sing, and she joined her sweet,
clear voice, without faltering, with me, and we tried to sing the
evening hymn we had been taught at the family altar:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;The day is past and gone,</p>
<p>The evening shades appear,&#8217; etc.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193"
id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p> <p>&#8220;My grief was too great.
The struggling emotions of my mind I tried to keep from her, but could
not. She said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t grieve for me; I have been a care to
you all the while. I don&#8217;t like to leave you here all alone, but
God is with you, and our heavenly Father will keep and comfort those
who trust in him. O, I am so glad that we were taught to love and serve
the Saviour.&#8217; She then asked me to sing the hymn commencing:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;How tedious and tasteless the hours</p>
<p class="i2">When Jesus no longer I see.&#8217;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I tried to sing, but could not get beyond the first line.
But it did appear that visions of a bright world were hers, as with a
clear, unfaltering strain she sang the entire hymn. She gradually sank
away without much pain, and all the time happy. She had not spent a
day in our captivity without asking God to pardon, to bless, and to
save. I was faint, and unable to stand upon my feet long at a time. My
cravings for food were almost uncontrollable; and at the same time,
among unfeeling savages, to watch her gradual but sure approach to the
vale of death, from want of food that their laziness alone prevented us
having in abundance, this was a time and scene upon which I can only
gaze with horror, and the very remembrance of which I would blot out if
I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;She lingered thus for several days. She suffered<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> much,
mostly from hunger. Often did I hear, as I sat near her weeping, some
Indian coming near break out in a rage, because I was permitted to
spend my time thus with her; that they had better kill Mary, then I
could go, as I ought to be made to go, and dig roots and procure food
for the rest of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;O what moments, what hours were these! Every object in all
the fields of sight seemed to wear a horrid gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day, during her singing, quite a crowd gathered about her
and seemed much surprised. Some of them would stand for whole hours
and gaze upon her countenance as if enchained by a strange sight, and
this while some of their own kindred were dying in other parts of the
village. Among these was the wife of the chief, &#8216;Aespaneo.&#8217;
I ought here to say that neither that woman nor her daughter ever gave
us any unkind treatment. She came up one day, hearing Mary sing, and
bent for some time silently over her. She looked in her face, felt of
her, and suddenly broke out in a most piteous lamentation. She wept,
and wept from the heart and aloud. I never saw a parent seem to feel
more keenly over a dying child. She sobbed, she moaned, she howled.
And thus bending over and weeping she stood the whole night. The next
morning, as I sat near my sister, shedding my tears in my hands, she
called me to her side and said: &#8216;I am willing to die. O, I<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> shall
be so much better off there!&#8217; and her strength failed. She tried
to sing, but was too weak.</p>

body as other Indians look on" /> </a> <div class="caption"> <p>DEATH
OF MARY ANN AT THE INDIAN CAMP.</p> </div> </div>

<p>&#8220;A number of the tribe, men, women, and children, were about
her, the chief&#8217;s wife watching her every moment. She died in a
few moments after her dying words quoted above.</p>

<p>&#8220;She sank to the sleep of death as quietly as sinks the
innocent infant to sleep in its mother&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I saw that she was dead, I could but give<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
myself up to loneliness, to wailing and despair. &#8216;The last of
our family dead, and all of them by tortures inflicted by Indian
savages,&#8217; I exclaimed to myself. I went to her and tried to find
remaining life, but no pulse, no breath was there. I could but adore
the mercy that had so wisely thrown a vail of concealment over these
three years of affliction. Had their scenes been mapped out to be read
beforehand, and to be received step by step, as they were really meted
out to us, no heart could have sustained them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wished and most earnestly desired that I might at once
lie down in the same cold, icy embrace that I saw fast stiffening the
delicate limbs of that dear sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reasoned at times, that die I must and soon, and that I had
the right to end my sufferings at once, and prevent these savages by
cold, cruel neglect, murdering me by the slow tortures of a starvation
that had already its score of victims in our village. The only heart
that shared my woes was now still, the only heart (as I then supposed)
that survived the massacre of seven of our family group was now cold
in death, and why should I remain to feel the gnawings of hunger and
pain a few days, and then, without any to care for me, unattended and
uncared for, lay down and die. At times I resolved to take a morsel of
food by stealth, (if it could be found,) and make a desperate attempt
to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197"
id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There were two, however, who seemed not wholly insensible
to my condition, these were the wife and daughter of the chief. They
manifested a sympathy that had not gathered about me since the first
closing in of the night of my captivity upon me. The Indians, at the
direction of the chief, began to make preparations to burn the body
of my sister. This, it seemed, I could not endure. I sought a place
to weep and pray, and I then tasted the blessedness of realizing
that there is One upon whom the heart&#8217;s heaviest load can be
placed, and He never disappointed me. My dark, suicidal thoughts
fled, and I became resigned to my lot. Standing by the corpse, with
my eyes fastened on that angel-countenance of Mary Ann, the wife of
the chief came to me and gave me to understand that she had by much
entreaty, obtained the permission of her lord to give me the privilege
of disposing of the dead body as I should choose. This was a great
consolation, and I thanked her most earnestly. It lifted a burden
from my mind that caused me to weep tears of gratitude, and also to
note the finger of that Providence to whom I had fully committed
myself, and whom I plainly saw strewing my way with tokens of his
kind regards toward me. The chief gave me two blankets, and in these
they wrapped the corpse. Orders were then given to two Indians to
follow my directions in disposing of the body. I selected a spot in
that little garden ground, where I had planted and wept with<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
my dear sister. In this they dug a grave about five feet deep, and
into it they gently lowered the remains of my last, my only sister,
and closed her last resting-place with the sand. The reader may
imagine my feelings, as I stood by that grave. The whole painful
past seemed to rush across my mind, as I lingered there. It was the
first and only grave in all that valley, and that inclosing my own
sister. Around me was a large company of half-dressed, fierce-looking
savages, some serious, some mourning, some laughing over this novel
method of disposing of the dead; others in breathless silence watched
the movements of that dark hour, with a look that seemed to say,
&#8216;This is the way white folks do,&#8217; and exhibiting no feeling
or care beyond that. I longed to plant a rose upon her grave, but the
Mohaves knew no beauty, and read no lesson in flowers, and so this
mournful pleasure was denied me.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the excitement of that hour passed, with it seemed
to pass my energy and ambition. I was faint and weak, drowsy and
languid. I found but little strength from the scant rations dealt out
to me. I was rapidly drooping, and becoming more and more anxious to
shut my eyes to all about me, and sink to a sweet, untroubled sleep
beneath that green carpeted valley. This was the only time in which,
without any reserve, I really longed to die, and cease at once to
breathe and suffer. That same woman, the wife of the chief, came
again to the solace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199"
id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> relief of my destitution and woe. I was
now able to walk but little, and had resigned all care and anxiety,
and concluded to wait until those burning sensations caused by want of
nourishment should consume the last thread of my life, and shut my eyes
and senses in the darkness that now hid them from my sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just at this time this kind woman came to me with some corn
gruel in a hollow stone. I marveled to know how she had obtained it.
The handful of seed corn that my sister and I had hid in the ground,
between two stones, did not come to my mind. But this woman, this
Indian woman, had uncovered a part of what she had deposited against
spring planting, had ground it to a coarse meal, and of it prepared
this gruel for me. I took it, and soon she brought me more. I began to
revive. I felt a new life and strength given me by this morsel, and was
cheered by the unlooked-for exhibition of sympathy that attended it.
She had the discretion to deny the unnatural cravings that had been
kindled by the small quantity she brought first, and dealt a little
at a time, until within three days I gained a vigor and cheerfulness
I had not felt for weeks. She bestowed this kindness in a sly and
unobserved manner, and enjoined secrecy upon me, for a reason which
the reader can judge. She had done it when some of her own kin were in
a starving condition. It waked up a hope within my bosom that reached
beyond the immediate kindness. I could not account for it but<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> by
looking to that Power in whose hands are the hearts of the savage as
well as the civilized man. I gathered a prospect from these unexpected
and kindly interpositions, of an ultimate escape from my bondage. It
was the hand of God, and I would do violence to the emotions I then
felt and still feel, violence to the strong determination I then made
to acknowledge all his benefits, if I should neglect this opportunity
to give a public, grateful record of my sense of his goodness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman had buried that corn to keep it from the lazy
crowd about her, who would have devoured it in a moment, and in utter
recklessness of next year&#8217;s reliance. She did it when deaths
by starvation and sickness were occurring every day throughout the
settlement. Had it not been for her, I must have perished. From this
circumstance I learned to chide my hasty judgment against <span
class="smcap">ALL</span> the Indian race, and also, that kindness is
not always a stranger to the untutored and untamed bosom. I saw in this
that their savageness is as much a fruit of their ignorance as of any
want of a susceptibility to feel the throbbings of true humanity, if
they could be properly appealed to.</p>

<p>&#8220;By my own exertions I was able now to procure a little
upon which to nourish my half-starved stomach. By using about half
of my seed corn, and getting an occasional small dose of bitter,
fermented oth-to-toa soup, I managed to drag my life along to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
March, 1854. During this month and April I procured a few small
roots, at a long distance from the village; also some fish from the
lake. I took particular pains to guard the little wheat garden that
we had planted the autumn before, and I also planted a few kernels
of corn and some melon seeds. Day after day I watched this little
&#8216;mutautea,&#8217; lest the birds might bring upon me another
winter like that now passed. In my absence Aespaneo would watch it for
me. As the fruit of my care and vigilant watching, I gathered about one
half bushel of corn, and about the same quantity of wheat. My melons
were destroyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the growing of this crop, I subsisted principally
upon a small root,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> about the size of a
hazel-nut, which I procured by traveling long distances, with fish.
Sometimes, after a long and fatiguing search, I would procure a handful
of these roots, and, on bringing them to camp, was compelled to divide
them with some stout, lazy monsters, who had been sunning themselves
all day by the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;I also came near losing my corn by the blackbirds. Driven
by the same hunger, seemingly, that was preying upon the human
tribe, they would fairly darken the air, and it was difficult to
keep them off, especially as I was compelled to be absent to get
food for immediate use. But they were not the only robbers I had
to contend against. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202"
id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> were some who, like our white loafers,
had a great horror of honest labor, and they would shun even a little
toil, with a conscientious abhorrence, at any hazard. They watched
my little corn-patch with hungry and thieving eyes, and, but for the
chief, would have eaten the corn green and in the ear. As harvest drew
near I watched, from before daylight until dark again, to keep off
these red vultures and the blackbirds from a spot of ground as large as
an ordinary dwelling-house. I had to do my accustomed share of musquite
gathering, also, in June and July. This we gathered in abundance. The
Colorado overflowed this winter and spring, and the wheat and corn
produced well, so that in autumn the tribe was better provided with
food than it had been for several years.</p>

<p>&#8220;The social habits of these Indians, and the traits of
character on which they are founded, and to which they give expression,
may be illustrated by a single instance as well as a thousand. The
portion of the valley over which the population extends, is about
forty miles long. Their convivial seasons were occasions of large
gatherings, tumultuous rejoicings, and (so far as their limited
productions would allow) of excess in feasting. The year 1854 was
one of unusual bounty and thrift. They planted more than usual; and
by labor and the overflow of the river, the seed deposited brought
forth an unparalleled increase. During the autumn of that year, the
residents of the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203"
id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> part of the valley set apart a day
for feasting and merry-making. Notice was given about four weeks
beforehand; great preparations were made, and a large number invited.
Their supply for the appetite on that day consisted of wheat, corn,
pumpkins, beans, etc. These were boiled, and portions of them mixed
with ground seed, such as serececa, (seed of a weed,) moeroco, (of
pumpkins.) On the day of the feast the Indians masked themselves, some
with bark, some with paint, some with skins. On the day previous to the
feast, the Indians of our part of the valley, who had been favored with
an invitation, were gathered at the house of the chief, preparatory to
taking the trip in company to the place of the feast. Some daubed their
faces and hair with mud, others with paint, so as to give to each an
appearance totally different from his or her natural state. I was told
that I could go along with the rest. This to me was no privilege, as
I knew too well what cruelty and violence they were capable of when
excited, as on their days of public gathering they were liable to be.
However, I was safer there than with those whom they left behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians went slowly, sometimes in regular, and sometimes
in irregular march, yelling, howling, singing, and gesticulating, until
toward night they were wrought up to a perfect phrenzy. They halted
about one mile from the &#8220;north settlement,&#8221; and after
building a fire, commenced their war-dance,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> which they kept up until
about midnight. On this occasion I witnessed some of the most shameful
indecencies, on the part of both male and female, that came to my eye
for the five years of my stay among Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning the Indians who had prepared the feast (some
of whom had joined in the dance of the previous evening) came with
their squaws, each bearing upon their heads a Coopoesech, containing
a cake, or a stone dish filled with soup, or boiled vegetables. These
cakes were made of wheat, ground, and mixed with boiled pumpkins.
This dough was rolled out sometimes to two feet in diameter; then
placed in hot sand, a leaf and a layer of sand laid over the loaf,
and a fire built over the whole, until it was baked through. After
depositing these dishes, filled with their prepared dainties, upon
a slight mound near by, the whole tribe then joined in a war-dance,
which lasted nearly twelve hours. After this the dishes and their
contents were taken by our party and borne back to our homes, when
and where feasting and dancing again commenced, and continued until
their supplies were exhausted, and they from sheer weariness were glad
to fly to the embrace of sleep. It would be a &#8216;shame even to
speak&#8217; of all the violence and indecency into which they plunged
on these occasions. Suffice it to say that no modesty, no sense of
shame, no delicacy, that throw so many wholesome hedges and limitations
about the respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205"
id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> sexes on occasions of conviviality where
civilization elevates and refines, were there to interfere with scenes
the remembrance of which creates a doubt whether these degraded bipeds
belong to the human or brute race.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus ended <em>one</em> of the many days of such performances that I
witnessed; and I found it difficult to decide whether most of barbarity
appeared in these, or at those seasons of wild excitement occasioned by
the rousing of their revengeful and brutal passions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all seasons during my captivity, these of concourse and
excitement most disgusted me with the untamed Indian. When I remember
what my eyes have witnessed, I am led to wonder and adore at my
preservation for a single year, or that my life was not brutalized, a
victim to their inhumanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt cheerful again, only when that loneliness and
desolateness which had haunted me since Mary&#8217;s death, would
sadden and depress my spirits. The same woman that had saved my life,
and furnished me with ground and seed to raise corn and wheat, and
watched it for me for many days, now procured from the chief a place
where I might store it, with the promise from him that every kernel
should go for my own maintenance.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not to go again over the melancholy events that have been
rehearsed in the last chapter, that we ask the reader to tarry for a
moment ere his eye begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206"
id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> to trace the remaining scenes of
Olive&#8217;s captivity, which furnish the next chapter, and in
which we see her under the light of a flickering, unsteady hope of a
termination of her captivity either by rescue or death.</p>

<p>But when in haste this chapter was penned for the first edition,
it was then, and has since been felt by the writer, that there was an
interest hanging about the events of the same, especially upon the
closing days and hours of little Mary&#8217;s brief life, that properly
called, according to the intent of this narrative, for a longer stay.
A penning of mere facts does not set forth, or glance at <em>all</em> that
clusters about that pale, dying child as she lies in the door of the
tent, the object of the enchained curious attention of the savages,
by whose cold neglect the flower of her sweet life was thus nipped
in the bud. And we feel confident of sharing, to some extent, the
feelings of the sensitive and intelligent reader, when we state that
the two years&#8217; suffering, by the pressure of which her life was
arrested, and the circumstances surrounding those dying moments, make
up a record, than which seldom has there been one that appeals to the
tender sensibilities of our being more directly, or to our serious
consideration more profitably.</p>

<p>Look at these two girls in the light of the first camp-fire
that glowed upon the faces of themselves and their captors, the
first dreary evening of their captivity. By one hour&#8217;s
cruel deeds and murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207"
id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> they had suddenly been bereft of
parents, brothers, and sisters, and consigned to the complete control
of a fiendish set of men, of the cruelty of whose tender mercies they
had already received the first and unerring chapter. Look at them
toiling day and night, from this on for several periods of twenty-four
hours, up rugged ascents, bruised and whipped by the ruggedness of
their way and the mercilessness of their lords. Their strength failing;
the distance between them and the home and way of the white man
increasing; the dreariness and solitude of the region enbosoming them
thickening; and each step brooded over by the horrors left behind,
and the worse horrors that sat upon the brightest future that at the
happiest rovings of fancy could be possibly anticipated.</p>

<p>In imagination we lean out our souls to listen to the sobs and
sighs that went up from those hearts&mdash;hearts bleeding from wounds
and pains tenfold more poignant than those that lacerated and wrung
their quivering flesh. We look upon them, as with their captors they
encircle the wild light of the successive camp-fires, kindled for long
distant halts, upon their way to the yet unseen and dreaded home of
the &#8220;inhabitants of rocks and tents.&#8221; We look upon them as
they are ushered into their new home, greeted with the most inhuman
and terror-kindling reception given them by this unfeeling horde
of land-sharks; thus to look, imagine, and ponder, we find enough,
especially when the <em>age</em> and <em>circumstances</em><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> of these captive girls
are considered, to lash our thoughts with indignation toward their
oppressors, and kindle our minds with more than we can express with the
word <em>sympathy</em> for these their innocent victims.</p>

<p>In little less than one year, and into that year is crowded all of
toil and suffering that we can credit as possible for them to survive,
and then they are sold and again <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for another new and strange
home, in a wild as distant from their Apache home as that from the hill
where, but a year before, in their warm flowing blood, their moaning,
mangled kindred had been left.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they reached the Mohave Valley ere the elder sister saw
with pain, the sad and already apparently irremovable effects of past
hardships upon the constitution of the younger. What tenderness, what
caution, what vigilant watching, what anxious, unrelieved solicitude
mark the conduct of that noble heart toward her declining and only
sister? Indeed, what interest prompted her to do all in her power to
preserve her life? Not only her only sister, but the only one (to her
then) that remained of the family from whom they had been ruthlessly
torn. And should her lamp of life cease, thereby would be extinguished
the last earthly solace and cordial for the dark prison life that
inclosed her, and that threw its walls of gloom and adamant between
her and the abodes and sunshine of civilized life. Yet death had<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
marked that little cherub girl for an early victim. Slowly, and yet
uncomplainingly, does her feeble frame and strength yield to the heavy
hand of woe and want that met her, in all the ghastliness and horror
of unchangeable doom, at every turn and hour of her weary days. What
mystery hangs upon events and persons! How impenetrable the permissions
of Providence! How impalpable and evasive of all our wisdom <em>that
secret power</em>, by which cherished plans and purposes are often shaped
to conclusions and terminations so wide of the bright design that
lighted them on to happy accomplishment in the mind of the mortal
proposer!</p>

<p>Mary Ann had been the fondly cherished, and tenderly nursed idol
of that domestic group. Early had she exhibited a precocity in
intellect, and in moral sensitiveness and attainment, that had made her
the subject of a peculiar parental affection, and the ever cheerful
radiating center of light, and love, and happiness to the remainder
of the juvenile family. But she ever possessed a strength of body and
vigor of health far inferior, and disproportioned to her mental and
moral progress. She was a correct reader at four years. She was kept
almost constantly at school, both from her choice, and the promise she
gave to delighted parents of a future appreciation and good improvement
of these advantages. With the early exhibition of an earnest thirst
for knowledge that she gave, there was also a strict regard for<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
truth, and a hearty, happy obedience to the law of God and the
authority of her parents. At five years and a half she had read her
Bible through. She was a constant attendant upon Sabbath school, into
all the exercises of which she entered with delight; and to her rapid
improvement and profit in the subjects with which she there became
intimate and identified, may be attributed the moral superiority she
displayed during her captivity.</p>

<p>She had a clear, sweet voice, and the children now live in this
state who have witnessed the earnestness and rapture with which she
joined in singing the hymns allotted to Sabbath-school hours. O how
little of the sad after-part of Mary&#8217;s life entered into the
minds of those parents as thus they directed the childish, tempted
steps of their little daughter into the paths of religious pursuits and
obedience.</p>

<p>Who shall say that the facts in her childish experience and years
herein glanced at, had not essentially to do with the spirit and
preparedness that she brought to the encountering and enduring of the
terrible fate that closed her eyes among savages at eight years of
age.</p>

<p>As we look at her fading, withering, and wasting at the touch of
cold cruelty, the object of anxious watchings and frequent and severe
painstaking on the part of her elder sister, who spared no labor or
fatigue to glean the saving morsel to prolong her sinking life, we can
but adore that never-sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211"
id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> Goodness that had strewn her way to this
dark scene with so many preparing influences and counsels.</p>

<p>Young as she was, she with her sister were first to voice those
hymns of praise to the one God, in which the grateful offerings
of Christian hearts go up to him, in the ear of an untutored and
demoralized tribe of savages. Hers was the first Christian death they
ever witnessed, perhaps the last; and upon her, as with composure and
cheerfulness (not the sullen submission of which they boast) she came
down to the vale of death, they gazed with every indication of an
interest and curiosity that showed the workings of something more than
the ordinary solemnities that had gathered them about the paling cheek
and quivering lip of members of their own tribe.</p>

<p>Precious girl! sweet flower! nipped in the bud by untimely and
rude blasts. Yet the fragrance of the ripe virtues that budded and
blossomed upon so tender and frail a stalk shall not die. If ever
the bright throng that flame near the throne would delight to cease
their song, descend and poise on steady wing to wait the last heaving
of a suffering mortal&#8217;s bosom, that at the parting breath they
might encircle the fluttering spirit and bear it to the bosom of God,
it was when thou didst, upon the breath of sacred song, joined in by
thy living sister, yield thy spirit to Him who kindly cut short thy
sufferings that he might begin thy bliss.</p>

<p>A Sabbath-school scholar, dying in an Indian<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> camp,
three hundred miles from even the nearest trail of the white man,
buoyed and gladdened by bright visions of beatitudes that make her
oblivious of present pain, and long to enter upon the future estate to
which a correct and earnest instruction had been pointing!</p>

<p>Who can say but that there lives the little Mohave boy or girl,
or the youth who will yet live to rehearse in the ear of a listening
American auditory, and in a rough, uncouth jargon, the wondrous
impression of that hour upon his mind.</p>

<p>Already we see the arms of civilization embracing a small remnant of
that waning tribe, and among its revived records, though unwritten, we
find the death of the American captive in the door of the chief&#8217;s
&#8220;<i>Pasiado</i>.&#8221; When they gathered about her at that dying
moment, many were the curious questions with which some of them sought
to ascertain the secret of her (to them) strange appearance. The
sacred hymns learned in Sabbath school and at a domestic shrine, and
upon which that little spirit now breathed its devout emotions in the
ear of God, were inquired after. They asked her where she expected to
go? She told them that she was going to a better place than the mound
to which they sent the spirits of their dead. And many questions did
they ask her and her older sister as to the extent of the knowledge
they had of such a bright world, if one there was. And though replies
to many of their queries before had been met<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> by mockings and
ridicule, yet now not one gazed, or listened, or questioned, to
manifest any disposition to taunt or accuse at the hour of that strange
dying.</p>

<p>The wife of the chief plied her questions with earnestness, and with
an air of sincerity, and the exhibition of the most intense mental
agitation, showing that she was not wholly incredulous of the new and
strange replies she received.</p>

<p class="center p2 f90">TALE OF THE TWO CAPTIVES.</p>

<p>One night a large company were assembled at the hut of one of
the sub-chiefs. It was said that this Indian, Adpadarama, was the
illegitimate son of the present chief, and there was considerable
dispute between him and two of the chief&#8217;s legitimate sons as to
their respective rights to the chiefship on the death of the father.</p>

<p>At the gathering referred to the following anecdote was related,
which is here given to show the strength of their superstitions, and
the unmitigated cruelties which are sometimes perpetrated by them
under the sanction of these barbaric beliefs. This sub-chief said that
one day, when he, in company with several of his relatives and two
Cochopa captives, was away in the mountains on a hunting-tour, his
(reputed) father fell violently sick. He grew worse for several days.
One day he was thought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214"
id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> be dying. &#8220;When I was convinced
that he could not live,&#8221; said Adpadarama, or to that effect,
&#8220;I resolved to kill one of the captives, and then wait until
my father should die, when I would kill the other. So I took a stone
tomahawk and went out to the little fire near the camping-tent, where
they were eating some berries they had just picked, and I told one of
them to step out, for I was a going to kill her to see if it would
not save my father. Then she cried,&#8221; (and at this he showed by
signs, and frowns, and all manner of gestures how delighted he was
at her misery,) &#8220;and begged for her life. But I went up to her
and struck her twice with this tomahawk, when she fell dead upon the
ground. I then told the other that I should kill her so soon as my
father died; that I should burn them both with his body, and then they
would go to be his slaves up in yonder eliercha,&#8221; (pointing to
their heavenly hill.) &#8220;Well, about two days after my father died,
and I was mad to think that the killing of the captive had not saved
him. So I went straight and killed the other, but I killed her by
burning, so as to be sure that the flames should take her to my father
to serve him forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such are facts that dimly hint at the vague and atrocious theories
that crowd their brain and hold iron sway over their minds. And in all
the abominations and indecencies authorized by their superstitions,
they are not only prompt and faithful, but the more degrading and
barbarous the rite, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215"
id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> does their zeal and enthusiasm kindle at
its performance.</p>

<p>Adpadarama said he burned, as soon as he returned, his
father&#8217;s house, and all his dishes, and utensils, and
bark-garments, so that his father might have them to contribute to his
happiness where he had gone.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">&#8220;In</span> the spring
of 1854, the project of some exciting hostile expedition against a
distant tribe was agitated among the Mohaves. It was some time before
any but the &#8216;Council&#8217; knew of the definite purpose of
the expedition. But when their plans had been laid, and all their
intentions circulated among the tribe, it proved to be one of war upon
the Cochopas, a large tribe seven hundred miles away. The Cochopas were
a tribe with whom the Mohaves had never been at peace. According to
tradition, this hostility had been kept actively flaming through all
past generations. And the Mohaves were relying with equal certainty
upon the truth of traditional prophecy that they were ultimately to
subject the Cochopas to their sway, or obliterate them. The Mohaves
had as yet been successful in every engagement. They were confident
of success, and this was all the glory their<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> ambition was capable of
grasping. As for any intrinsic merit in the matter of the contest, none
was known to exist. About sixty warriors made preparations for a long
time to undertake the expedition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bows and arrows and war-clubs were prepared in abundance,
also stone-knives. The war-club was made of a very solid wood
that grew upon the mountain. It was of a tree that they called
&#8216;Cooachee,&#8217; very hard and heavy, and lost but very little
of its weight in the seasoning process.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great preparations were also made by the squaws, though
with much reluctance, as most of them were opposed to the expedition,
as they had been also in the past to kindred ones. Those of them who
had husbands and brothers enlisted in the expedition, tried every
expedient in their power to dissuade them from it. They accused them
of folly and a mere lust of war, and prayed them not thus to expose
their own lives and the lives of their dependent ones. It was reported
that since the last attack upon them, the Cochopees had strengthened
themselves with numerous and powerful allies, by uniting several
surrounding tribes with themselves for purposes of war. This was
pleaded by these interested women against the present purpose, as they
feared that this distant tribe would be now able to avenge past injury,
besides beating the Mohaves in this projected engagement. But go they
would, and on the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218"
id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> their departure there was a convocation
of nearly the whole tribe, and it was a time of wild, savage excitement
and deep mourning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I soon learned, though by mere accident, that so far as life
was concerned, I had an interest in this expedition equal to that of
the most exposed among the warriors. It had been an unvarying custom
among them that if any of their number should be slain in battle, the
lives of prisoners or captives must be sacrificed therefor, up to the
number of the slain, (if that number should be among them,) and that
in the most torturing manner. This was not done to appease their gods,
for they had none, but was a gift to the spirits of the other spheres.
Their only theory about a Supreme Being is that there is a chief of all
the Indians who reigns in splendor and pomp, and that his reign is one
of wisdom and equity, and would last forever. They believed that at the
gate of their elysium a porter was in constant attendance, who received
all good, brave Indians, and welcomed them to immense hunting-grounds
and all manner of sensual pleasures; that if one sought admittance
there without a bow and hunting implements, he was to subsist as best
he could, for no provision was to be made for him after leaving his
tribe. Many were the questions they asked me after they had ascertained
what I believed concerning the nature of the heaven of which I
spoke, and the employments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219"
id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> there. But generally they would wind
up the conversation with ridicule and mockings. When they saw me weep
or in trouble they would sometimes say: &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you
look up and call your great God out of the sky, and have him take you
up there.&#8217; But under all this I could plainly see that their
questions were not wholly insincere. They frequently marveled, and
occasionally one would say: &#8216;You whites are a singular people;
I should like to know what you will be when a great many moons have
gone by?&#8217; Sometimes they would say as did the Apaches, that we
must be fools for believing that heaven was above the sky; that if it
were so the people would drop down. One of the squaws said tauntingly
to me: &#8216;When you go to your heaven you had better take a strong
piece of bark and tie yourself up, or you will be coming down among
us again.&#8217; After the soldiers had departed they told me plainly
that my life must pay for the first one that might be slain during this
contest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had but a little before learned that we were not much
further from the white settlements than when among the Apaches, and
had been fondly hoping that as parties of the tribe occasionally
made excursions to the settlements, I might yet make my situation
known and obtain relief. But now I was shut up to the alternatives
of either making an immediate effort to escape, which would<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> be
sure to cost my life if detected, or to wait in dreadful suspense the
bare probability of none of these soldiers being slain, as the only
chance for myself if I remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;The report of the strengthening of the Cochopas since their
last expedition gave me reason to fear the worst. Thus for a long time,
and just after having reached a bright place (if such there can be in
such a situation) in my captivity, I was thrown into the gloomiest
apprehensions for my life. I could not calculate upon life; I did
not.</p>

<p>&#8220;For five months not a night did I close my eyes for a
troubled sleep, or wake in the morning but last and first were the
thoughts of the slender thread upon which my life was hung. The faint
prospect in which I had been indulging, that their plans of increasing
traffic with the Mexicans and whites might open the doors for my
return, was now nearly blasted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been out one fine day in August several miles gathering
roots for the chief&#8217;s family, and returning a little before
sunset, as I came in sight of the village I saw an Indian at some
distance beyond the town descending a hill to the river from the other
side. He was so far away that it was impossible for me to tell whether
he was a Yuma or a Mohave. These two tribes were on friendly terms, and
frequent &#8216;criers&#8217; or news-carriers passed between them. I
thought at once of the absent warriors, and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> of my vital interest in
the success or failure of their causeless, barbarous crusade. I soon
saw that he was a Mohave, and tremblingly believed that I could mark
him as one of the army.</p>

<p>&#8220;With trembling and fear I watch his hastened though evidently
wearied pace. He went down into the river and as he rose again upon the
bank I recognized him. &#8216;He is wearied,&#8217; I said, &#8216;and
jogs heavily along as though he had become nearly exhausted from
long travel. Why can he be coming in alone?&#8217; Questions of this
character played across my mind, and were asked aloud by me ere I was
aware, each like a pointed javelin lashing and tormenting my fears.
&#8216;Have the rest all perished?&#8217; again I exclaimed; &#8216;at
any rate the decisive hour has come with me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped; my approach to the village had not been observed.
I resolved to wait and seek to cover one desperate effort to escape
under the first shades of night. I threw myself flat upon the ground;
I looked in every direction; mountain chains were strung around me
on every side like bulwarks of adamant, and if trails led through
them I knew them not. I partly raised myself up. I saw that Indian
turn into a hut upon the outskirts of the town. In a few moments the
&#8216;criers&#8217; were out and bounding to the river and to the foot
hills. Each on his way started others, and soon the news was flying
as on telegraphic wires. &#8216;<i>But what<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> news?</i>&#8217; I could
but exclaim. I started up and resolved to hasten to our hut and wait in
silence the full returns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could imagine that I saw my doom written in the countenance
of every Mohave I met. But each one maintained a surly reserve or
turned upon me a sarcastic smile. A crowd was gathering fast, but not
one word was let fall for my ear. In total, awful silence I looked,
I watched, I guessed, but dared not speak. It seemed that every one
was reading and playing with my agitation. Soon the assemblage was
convened, a fire was lighted, and &#8216;Ohitia&#8217; rose up to
speak; I listened, and my heart seemed to leap to my mouth as he
proceeded to state, in substance, thus: &#8216;Mohaves have triumphed;
five prisoners taken; all on their way; none of our men killed; they
will be in to-morrow!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again one of the blackest clouds that darkened the sky of
my Mohave captivity broke, and the sunshine of gladness and gratitude
was upon my heart. Tears of gratitude ran freely down my face. I
buried my face in my hands and silently thanked God. I sought a place
alone, where I might give full vent to my feelings of thanksgiving to
my heavenly Father. I saw his goodness, in whose hands are the reins
of the wildest battle storm, and thanked him that this expedition, so
freighted with anxiety, had issued so mercifully to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next day four more came in with the captives,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> and
in a few days all were returned, without even a scar to tell of the
danger they had passed. The next day after the coming of the last
party, a meeting of the whole tribe was called, and one of the most
enthusiastic rejoicing seasons I ever witnessed among them it was.
It lasted, indeed, for several days. They danced, sung, shouted, and
played their corn-stalk flutes until for very weariness they were
compelled to refrain. It was their custom never to eat salted meat for
the next moon after the coming of a captive among them. Hence our salt
fish were for several days left to an undisturbed repose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the captives they had stolen from the unoffending
Cochopas, and brought in with them, was a handsome, fair complexioned
young woman, of about twenty-five years of age. She was as beautiful
an Indian woman as I have ever seen; tall, graceful, and ladylike in
her appearance. She had a fairer, lighter skin than the Mohaves or the
other Cochopa captives. But I saw upon her countenance and in her eyes
the traces of an awful grief. The rest of the captives appeared well
and indifferent about themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;This woman called herself &#8216;Nowereha.&#8217; Her
language was as foreign to the Mohaves as the American, except to
the few soldiers that had been among them. The other captives were
girls from twelve to sixteen years old; and while they seemed to wear
a &#8216;don&#8217;t care&#8217; appearance, this Nowereha<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> was
perfectly bowed down with grief. I observed she tasted but little food.
She kept up a constant moaning and wailing, except when checked by the
threats of her boastful captors. I became very much interested in her,
and sought to learn the circumstances under which she had been torn
from her home. Of her grief I thought I knew something. She tried to
converse with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;With much difficulty I learned of her what had happened
since the going of the Mohave warriors among her tribe, and this fully
explained her extreme melancholy. Their town was attacked in the night
by the Mohave warriors, and after a short engagement the Cochopas were
put to flight; the Mohaves hotly pursued them. Nowereha had a child
about two months old; but after running a short distance her husband
came up with her, grasped the child, and run on before. This was an
act showing a humaneness that a Mohave warrior did not possess, for he
would have compelled his wife to carry the child, he kicking her along
before him. She was overtaken and captured.</p>

<p>&#8220;For one week Nowereha wandered about the village by day,
a perfect image of desperation and despair. At times she seemed
insane: she slept but little at night. The thieving, cruel Mohaves
who had taken her, and were making merry over her griefs, knew full
well the cause of it all. They knew that without provocation they
had robbed her of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225"
id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> child, and her child of its mother. They
knew the attraction drawing her back to her tribe, and they watched her
closely. But no interest or concern did they manifest save to mock and
torment her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Early one morning it was noised through the village that
Nowereha was missing. I had observed her the day before, when the
chief&#8217;s daughter gave her some corn, to take part of the same,
after grinding the rest, to make a cake and hide it in her dress. When
these captives were brought in, they were assigned different places
through the valley at which to stop. Search was made to see if she
had not sought the abiding-place of some of her fellow-captives. This
caused some delay, which I was glad to see, though I dared not express
my true feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;When it was ascertained that she had probably undertaken to
return, every path and every space dividing the immediate trails was
searched, to find if possible some trace to guide a band of pursuers.
A large number were stationed in different parts of the valley, and
the most vigilant watch was kept during the night, while others
started in quest of her upon the way they supposed she had taken to
go back. When I saw a day and night pass in these fruitless attempts,
I began to hope for the safety of the fugitive. I had seen enough of
her to know that she was resolved and of unconquerable determination.
Some conjectured that she had been betrayed away; others that she
had drowned herself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226"
id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> others that she had taken to the river
and swam away. They finally concluded that she had killed herself, and
gave up the search, vowing that if she had fled they would yet have her
and be avenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just before night, several days after this, a Yuma Indian
came suddenly into camp, driving this Cochopa captive. She was the
most distressed-looking being imaginable when she returned. Her hair
disheveled, her few old clothes torn, (they were woolen clothes,) her
eyes swollen, and every feature of her noble countenance distorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Criers&#8217; were kept constantly on the way between
the Mohaves and Yumas, bearing news from tribe to tribe. These
messengers were their news-carriers and sentinels. Frequently two
criers were employed, (sometimes more,) one from each tribe. These
would have their meeting-stations. At these stations these criers
would meet with promptness, and by word of mouth each would deposit
his store of news with his fellow-expressman, and then each would
return to his own tribe with the news. When the news was important,
or was of a warning character, as in time of war, they would not
wait for the fleet foot of the &#8216;runner,&#8217; but had their
signal fires well understood, which would telegraph the news hundreds
of miles in a few hours. One of these Yuma criers, about four days
after the disappearance of Nowereha, was coming to his station on
the road connecting these two tribes, when he spied a woman<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> under
a shelf of the rock on the opposite side of the river. He immediately
plunged into the stream and went to her. He knew the tribe to which
she belonged, and that the Mohaves had been making war upon them. He
immediately started back with her to the Mohave village. It was a law
to which they punctually lived, to return all fleeing fugitives or
captives of a friendly tribe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed that she had concealed that portion of the corn
meal she did not bake, with a view of undertaking to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;When she went out that night she plunged immediately into the
river to prevent them from tracking her. She swam several miles that
night, and then hid herself in a willow wood; thinking that they would
be in close pursuit, she resolved to remain there until they should
give up hunting for her. Here she remained nearly two days, and her
pursuers were very near her several times. She then started, and swam
where the river was not too rapid and shallow, when she would out and
bound over the rocks. In this way, traveling only in the night, she
had gone near one hundred and thirty miles. She was, as she supposed,
safely hid in a cave, waiting the return of night, when the Yuma found
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;On her return another noisy meeting was called, and
they spent the night in one of their <em>victory</em> dances. They
would dance around her, shout in her ears, spit in her face, and
show their threats of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228"
id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> murderous design, assuring her that
they would soon have her where she would give them no more trouble by
running away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning a post was firmly placed in the ground,
and about eight feet from the ground a cross-beam was attached. They
then drove large, rough wooden spikes through the palms of poor
Nowereha&#8217;s hands, and by these they lifted her to the cross and
drove the spikes into the soft wood of the beam, extending her hands as
far as they could. They then, with pieces of bark stuck with thorns,
tied her head firmly back to the upright post, drove spikes through her
ankles, and for a time left her in this condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;They soon returned, and placing me with their Cochopa
captives near the sufferer, bid us keep our eyes upon her until she
died. This they did, as they afterward said, to exhibit to me what
I might expect if they should catch me attempting to escape. They
then commenced running round Nowereha in regular circles, hallooing,
stamping, and taunting like so many demons, in the most wild and
frenzied manner. After a little while several of them supplied
themselves with bows and arrows, and at every circlet would hurl one
of these poisoned instruments of death into her quivering flesh.
Occasionally she would cry aloud, and in the most pitiful manner.
This awakened from that mocking, heartless crowd the most deafening
yells.</p>

    <p>HORRID DEATH OF THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;She hung in this dreadful condition for over two hours ere
I was certain she was dead, all the while bleeding and sighing, her
body mangled in the most shocking manner. When she would cry aloud they
would stuff rags in her mouth, and thus silence her. When they were
quite sure she was dead, and that they could no longer inflict pain
upon her, they took her body to a funeral pile and burned it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had before this thought, since I had come to know of the
vicinity of the whites, that I would get<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> some knowledge of the
way to their abodes by means of the occasional visits the Mohaves made
to them, and make my escape. But this scene discouraged me, however,
and each day I found myself, not without hope it is true, but settling
down into such contentment as I could with my lot. For the next
eighteen months during which I was witness to their conduct, these
Mohaves took more care and exercised more forethought in the matter of
their food. They did not suffer, and seemed to determine not to suffer
the return of a season like 1852.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw but little reason to expect anything else than the
spending of my years among them, and I had no anxiety that they should
be many. I saw around me none but savages, and (dreadful as was the
thought) among whom I must spend my days. There were some with whom I
had become intimately acquainted, and from whom I had received humane
and friendly treatment, exhibiting real kindness. I thought it best now
to conciliate the best wishes of all, and by every possible means to
avoid all occasions of awakening their displeasure, or enkindling their
unrepentant, uncontrollable temper and passions.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were some few for whom I began to feel a degree
of attachment. Every spot in that valley that had any attraction,
or offered a retreat to the sorrowing soul, had become familiar,
and upon much of its adjacent scenery I delighted to gaze.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> Every
day had its monotony of toil, and thus I plodded on.</p>

<p>&#8220;To escape seemed impossible, and to make an unsuccessful
attempt would be worse than death. Friends or kindred to look after
or care for me, I had none, as I then supposed. I thought it best to
receive my daily allotment with submission, and not darken it with
a borrowed trouble; to merit and covet the good-will of my captors,
whether I received it or not. At times the past, with all its checkered
scenes, would roll up before me, but all of it that was most deeply
engraven upon my mind was that which I would be soonest to forget if
I could. Time seemed to take a more rapid flight; I hardly could wake
up to the reality of so long a captivity among savages, and really
imagined myself happy for short periods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I considered my age, my sex, my exposure, and was again in
trouble, though to the honor of these savages let it be said, they
never offered the least unchaste abuse to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the summer of 1855 I was eye-witness to another
illustration of their superstition, and of its implacability when
appealed to. The Mohaves had but a simple system or theory of medicine.
They divide disease into spiritual and physical, or at least they
used terms that conveyed such an impression as this to my mind. The
latter they treated mainly to an application of their medical leaf,
generally sweating the patient by wrapping him in blankets and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
placing him over the steam from these leaves warmed in water. For the
treatment of their spiritual or more malignant diseases they have
physicians. All diseases were ranked under the latter class that had
baffled the virtue of the medical leaf, and that were considered
dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the summer of 1855 a sickness prevailed to a considerable
extent, very much resembling in its workings the more malignant fevers.
Several died. Members of the families of two of the sub-chiefs were
sick, and their physicians were called. These &#8216;M.D.s&#8217; were
above the need of pills, and plasters, and powders, and performed
their cures by manipulations, and all manner of contortions of their
own bodies, which were performed with loud weeping and wailing of
the most extravagant kind over the sick. They professed to be in
league and intimacy with the spirits of the departed, and from
whose superior knowledge and position they were guided in all their
curative processes. Two of these were called to the sick bedside of
the children of these chiefs. They wailed and wrung their hands, and
twisted themselves into all manner of shapes over them for some time,
but it was in vain, the patients died. They had lost several patients
lately, and already their medical repute was low in the market. Threats
had already followed them from house to house, as their failures
were known. After the death of these children of rank, vengeance
was sworn upon them, as they were accused<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> of having bargained
themselves to the evil spirits for purpose of injury to the tribe. They
knew of their danger and hid themselves on the other side of the river.
For several days search was made, but in vain. They had relatives and
friends who kept constant guard over them. But such was the feeling
created by the complainings of those who had lost children and friends
by their alleged conspiracy with devils, that the tribe demanded their
lives, and the chief gave orders for their arrest. But their friends
managed in a sly way to conceal them for some time, though they did not
dare to let their managery be known to the rest of the tribe. They were
found, arrested, and burned alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Mohaves believe that when their friends die they depart
to a certain high hill in the western section of their territory. That
they there pursue their avocation free from the ills and pains of their
present life, if they had been good and brave. But they held that all
cowardly Indians (and bravery was <em>the</em> good with them) were tormented
with hardships and failures, sickness and defeats. This hill or hades,
they never dared visit. It was thronged with thousands who were ready
to wreak vengeance upon the mortal who dared intrude upon this sacred
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to the middle of February, 1856, nothing occurred
connected with my allotment that would be of interest to the reader.
One day as I was grinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234"
id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> musquite near the door of our dwelling,
a lad came running up to me in haste, and said that Francisco, a Yuma
crier, was on his way to the Mohaves, and that he was coming to try
and get me away to the whites. The report created a momentary strange
sensation, but I thought it probably was a rumor gotten up by these
idlers (as they were wont to do) merely to deceive and excite me to
their own gratification. In a few moments, however, the report was
circulating on good authority, and as a reality. One of the sub-chiefs
came in said that a Yuma Indian, named Francisco, was now on his way
with positive orders for my immediate release and safe return to the
fort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that there were white persons at Fort Yuma, but did
not know my distance from the place. I knew, too, that intercourse
of some kind was constantly kept up with the Yumas and the tribes
extending that way, and thought that they had perhaps gained traces
of my situation by this means. But as yet I had nothing definite upon
which to place confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw in a few hours that full credit was given to the
report by the Mohaves, for a sudden commotion was created, and it was
enkindling excitement throughout the settlement. The report spread
over the valley with astonishing speed, by means of their criers,
and a crowd was gathering, and the chiefs and principal men were
summoned to a council by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235"
id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> head &#8216;Aespaniola,&#8217; with
whom I stayed. Aespaniola was a tall, strongly built man, active and
generally happy. He seemed to possess a mildness of disposition and to
maintain a gravity and seriousness in deportment that was rare among
them. He ruled a council (noisy as they sometimes were) with an ease
and authority such as but few Indians can command, if the Mohaves be
a fair example. This council presented the appearance of an aimless
convening of wild maniacs, more than that of <em>men</em>, met to deliberate.
I looked upon the scene as a silent but narrowly watched spectator, but
was not permitted to be in the crowd or to hear what was said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew the declared object of the gathering, and was the
subject of most anxious thoughts as to its issue and results. I thought
I saw upon the part of some of them, a designed working of themselves
into a mad phrenzy, as if preparatory to some brutal deed. I queried
whether yet the report was not false; and also as to the persons who
had sent the reported message, and by whom it might be conveyed. I
tried to detect the prevailing feeling among the most influential
of the council, but could not. Sometimes I doubted whether all this
excitement could have been gotten up on the mere question of my return
to the whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;For some time past they had manifested but little
watchfulness, care, or concern about me. But still, though I
was debarred from the council, I had<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> heard enough to know
that it was only about me and the reported demand for my liberty.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the midst of the uproar and confusion the approach of
Francisco was announced. The debate suddenly ceased, and it was a
matter of much interest to me to be able to mark, as I did, the various
manifestations by which different ones received him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some were sullen, and would hardly treat him with any
cordiality; others were indifferent, and with a shake of the head would
say, &#8216;Degee, degee, ontoa, ontoa,&#8217; (I don&#8217;t care for
the captive;) others were angry, and advised that he be kept out of the
council and driven back at once; others were dignified and serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Francisco enter the council, and I was at once seized
by two Indians and bade be off to another part of the village. I found
myself shut up alone, unattended, unprotected. A message as from a land
of light had suddenly broken in upon my dark situation, and over it,
and also over my destiny; the most intense excitement was prevailing,
more vehement, if possible, than any before, and I denied the privilege
of a plea or a word to turn the scale in favor of my rights, my
yearnings, my hopes, or my prayers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did pray God then to rule that council. My life was again
hung up as upon a single hair. The most of my dread for the present
was, that these savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> of untamed passions would become excited
against my release, and enraged that the place of my abode had been
found out. I feared and trembled for my fate, and could not sleep. For
three days and most of three nights this noisy council continued; at
times the disputants became angry (as Francisco afterward told me) as
rival opinions and resolutions fired their breasts. As yet I knew not
by what means my locality had become known, or who had sent the demand;
nor did I know as yet that anything more than a word of mouth message
had been sent.&#8221;</p>

Black&mdash;Mr. Grinell&mdash;Petitions the Governor&mdash;Petitions
Congress&mdash;The Report of the Rescue of Olive&mdash;Mr. Low.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> now ask the reader
to trace with us for a few pages, a brief account of the movements and
efforts (mainly by her brother) by which this scene had been waked
up in the captive home of Miss Olive, and that had extended this new
opening for her rescue. In chapter third we left Lorenzo disabled, but
slowly recovering from the effect of his bruises, at Fort Yuma. Of the
kindness of Dr. Hewit we there spoke.</p>

<p>We here give a narrative of the winding, care-thorned course of
the boy of scarce fifteen years, for the next five years, and the
ceaseless toil and vigilance he exercised to restore those captive
sisters; as we have received the items from his own mouth. It is worth
the painstaking that its perusal will cost, showing as it does, a true
affection and regard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> his kindred, while the discretion and
perseverance by which his promptings were guided would do honor to the
man of thirty.</p>

<p>He was at Fort Yuma three months, or nearly that time. Dr. Hewit
continued to watch over him up to San Francisco, and until he went
East, and then provided for him a home. Besides, he did all in his
power to aid him in ascertaining some traces of his sisters. At
the fort Lorenzo knew that his sisters were captives. He entreated
Commander Heinsalman, as well as did others, to make some effort
to regain them, but it was vain that he thus pleaded for help. The
officers and force at the fort were awake to the reasonableness and
justice of his plea. Some of them anxiously longed to make a thorough
search for them. They were not permitted to carry the exposed family
bread and needed defense, but had been out and seen the spot where they
had met a cruel death, and now they longed to follow the savage Apache
to his hiding-place, break the arm of the oppressor, and if possible,
rescue the living spoil they had taken. The short time of absence
granted to Lieutenant Maury and Captain Davis, though well filled up
and faithfully, could not reach the distant captives.</p>

<p>At times this brother resolved to arm himself, and take a pack of
provisions and start, either to accomplish their rescue or die with
them. But this step would have only proved a short road to one of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> their
funeral piles. In June of this year the entire force was removed from
the fort to San Diego, except about a dozen men to guard the ferrymen.
On the 26th of June, with Dr. Hewit, Lorenzo came to San Francisco.
After Dr. Hewit had left for the States he began to reflect on his
loneliness, and more deeply than ever upon his condition and that of
his sisters. Sometimes he would stray upon the hills at night in the
rear of the city, so racked with despair and grief as to determine upon
taking his own life, if he could not secure the rescue of the captives.
He found the stirring, throbbing life of San Francisco beating almost
exclusively to the impulses of gold-hunting. Of acquaintances he had
none, nor did he possess any desire to make them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Often,&#8221; he says, &#8220;have I strolled out upon these
sidewalks and traveled on until I was among the hills to which these
streets conducted me, to the late hour of the night, stung by thinking
and reflecting upon the past and present of our family kingdom.&#8221;
He was given employment by the firm in whose care he had been left
by Dr. Hewit. He soon found that tasks were assigned him in the
wholesale establishment beyond his years and strength. He seriously
injured himself by lifting, and was compelled to leave. &#8220;This
I regretted,&#8221; he says, &#8220;for I found non-employment a
misery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every hour his mind was still haunted by the <em>one all-absorbing
theme</em>! His sisters, his own dear sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> spirit of his spirit,
and blood of his blood, were in captivity. For aught he knew, they were
suffering cruelties and abuse worse than death itself, at the hands of
their captors. He could not engage steadily in any employment. Dark and
distressing thoughts were continually following him. No wonder that he
would often break out with utterances like these: &#8220;O my God! must
they there remain? Can there be no method devised to rescue them? Are
they still alive, or have they suffered a cruel death? I will know if I
live.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had no disposition to make acquaintances, unless to obtain
sympathy and help for the one attempt that from the first he had
meditated; no temptation to plunge into vice to drown his trouble, for
he only lived to see them rescued, if yet alive.</p>

<p>Thus three years passed away, some of the time in the mines and a
portion of it in the city. Frequently his sadness was noticed, and
its cause kindly inquired after, upon which he would give an outline
of the circumstances that had led to his present uncheered condition.
Some would weep and manifest much anxiety to do something to aid him
in the recovery of his lost kindred; others would wonder and say
nothing; others&mdash;<em>strangers!</em>&mdash;were sometimes incredulous,
and scoffed. He knew that the route by which he had reached this
country was still traveled by emigrants, and he resolved upon going
to Los Angeles with the hope that he might there obtain<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
some knowledge of the state of things in the region of Fort Yuma.
Accordingly, in October of 1854, he started for that place, and
resolved there to stay until he might obtain some traces of his
sisters, if it should take a whole lifetime. He found there those who
had lately passed over the road, and some who had spent a short time at
the stopping-places so sadly familiar to him. He inquired, and wrote
letters, and used all diligence (as some persons now in that region,
and others in San Francisco can bear witness) to accomplish the one
end of all his care. He worked by the month a part of the time to earn
a living, and spent the remainder in devising and setting on foot
means to explore the region lying about Fort Yuma and beyond. Thus,
in the most miserable state of mind, and in utter fruitlessness of
endeavor, passed away almost a year. During the spring of 1855 several
emigrants came by this trail. Of them he could learn nothing, only
that they had heard at Fort Yuma of the fate of the &#8220;family of
Oatmans.&#8221;</p>

<p>One company there was who told him of a Mr. Grinell, a carpenter
at Fort Yuma, who had told them that he knew of the massacre of the
Oatman family, and of the captivity of the girls, and that he intended
to do all in his power to recover them. He said that their brother, who
was left for dead, was now alive, and at Los Angeles; that a letter
had been received at the fort from him concerning his sisters,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> and
that he should exert himself to find them out and rescue them. This
Mr. Grinell also stated that he had come to Fort Yuma in 1853, and had
been making inquiries of the Yumas ever since concerning these captive
girls. Beyond this, no ray of light broke upon the thickening gloom
of that despairing brother. He tried to raise companions to attend
him in the pursuit of them to the mountains. At one time names were
registered, and all preparations made by a large company of volunteers,
who were going out for this purpose, but a trivial circumstance broke
up the anticipated expedition and frustrated the whole plan. And at
other times other kindred plans were laid, and well-nigh matured, but
some unforeseen occasion for postponement or abandonment would suddenly
come up. He found friends, and friends to the cherished ambition of his
heart, in whom flowed the currents of a true and positive sympathy, and
who were ready to peril life in assisting him in the consummation of
his life-object. And often he found this concealed under the roughest
garb, while sometimes smooth words and a polished exterior proffered no
means of help beyond mere appearance.</p>

<p>He says: &#8220;I learned, amid the harassings of that year
two things: 1. That men did not come across the plains to hunt
captives among the Indians; 2. That a true sympathy is oftenest
found among those who have themselves also suffered.&#8221; He<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> found
that to engage an ally in an undertaking dictated by pity for suffering
friends, one must go among those who have felt the pang of kindred
ills. Often, when he thought all was ready to start with an engaged
party to scour the Apache country, did he find some trifling excuse
called in to cover a retreat from an undertaking with which these
subjects of a &#8220;show sympathy&#8221; had no <em>real</em> interest from
the first. Thus he came to learn human nature, but was not discouraged.
Could we turn upon these pages the full tide of the heart-yearnings
and questionings that struggled in that young man&#8217;s heart, by
daylight, by twilight, by moonlight, as he strolled (as often he did)
for reflection upon old ocean&#8217;s shore, on the sandy beach, in the
wood, it might cause the heart of the reader to give heed to the tales
of true grief that daily strew his way, and kindle a just contempt for
a <em>mere artificial sympathy</em>.</p>

<p>The year 1855 found him undaunted, still pressing on to the
dictates of <em>duty to his beloved sisters</em>. Every failure and mishap
but kindled his zeal anew. Parties of men organized late in 1855
to hunt gold on the Mohave River, about one hundred miles from San
Bernardino. He joined several of these, with the promise from men
among them that they would turn their excursion into a hunt for his
kindred. Once he succeeded in getting as far as, and even beyond
(though further north) Fort Yuma. But still he could not prevail
upon a sufficient number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245"
id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> to go as far as the Apache country to
make it safe to venture. Many would say that his sisters were dead, and
it was useless to hunt them. He joined surveying parties with this same
one object in view. In 1855 a force equal to the one that was there in
1851 was again at Fort Yuma, and several of the same officers and men.
The place of Commander Heinsalman had been filled by another man. In
December, 1855, a party of five men resolved to join Mr. Oatman and
search for his sisters until some definite knowledge of them might be
obtained. They spent several weeks south and west of Fort Yuma, and had
returned to San Bernardino to re-supply themselves with provisions for
a trip further north.</p>

<p>While at this place Lorenzo received a letter from a friend residing
at the Monte, and stating that a Mr. Rowlit had just come in across
the plains; that he spent some time at Fort Yuma, and there learned
from the officers that, through the Yuma Indians, Mr. Grinell had
gathered intimations of the fact of there being two white girls among
the Mohaves, and that these Yumas had stated that they were a part of
a family who had been attacked, and some of them murdered, in 1851,
by the Apaches. That the Apaches had since sold these girls to the
Mohaves. &#8220;This letter,&#8221; says Lorenzo, &#8220;I wet with my
tears. I thought of that little Mary Ann, of the image that my last
look into her face had left, and then of Olive. I began to reckon
up their present age, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246"
id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> the years of dark captivity that had
passed over them. Can they yet be alive? May I yet see them? Will God
help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lorenzo reached the Monte, after traveling all night, the next day
about seven A. M. He saw Mr. Rowlit, and found the contents of the
letter corroborated by him. He prepared a statement of the facts, and
sent them to the &#8220;Los Angeles Star.&#8221; These the editor
published, kindly accompanying them by some well-timed and stirring
remarks. This awakened an interest that the community had not felt
before. While this was yet alive in the hearts and mouths of the
people, a Mr. Black came into town, just from the East, by way of Fort
Yuma. He stated that two girls were among the Mohaves, and that the
chief had offered them to the officers at the fort for a mere nominal
price, but that Commander Burke had refused to make the purchase.
Of this statement Lorenzo knew nothing until he had seen it in the
&#8220;Star.&#8221; This threw a shade upon his mind, and gave him to
think less of poor humanity than ever before. He found that but few
placed any reliance upon the report. Mr. Black was well known in that
vicinity, and those who knew him best were disposed to suspend judgment
until the statement should be supported by other authority.</p>

<p>The editor of the &#8220;Star&#8221; had published the report with
the best intentions, giving his authority. This report reached the
fort, and created a great deal of sensation.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> They sent the editor
a letter denying the truthfulness of the report, and requesting him
to publish it, which he did. Accompanying the letter was a statement
confirming the existence of a report at the fort of reliable
intimations of the two girls being among the Mohaves, but that no offer
had been made of delivering them up to the whites on any terms.</p>

<p>During this time Lorenzo had drawn up a petition, and obtained a
large number of signers, praying of the Governor of California means
and men to go and rescue his captive sisters. This was sent to Governor
Johnson, at Sacramento, and the following reply was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right mr3">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Executive Department</span>,</p>

<p class="right mr1">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sacramento, Cal.</span>, <i>Jan&#8217;y 29, 1856</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Lorenzo D. Oatman.
Sir</span>,&mdash;A petition signed by yourself and numerous residents
of the County of Los Angeles has been presented to me, asking
assistance of &#8216;men and means&#8217; to aid in the recovery of
your sister, a captive among the Mohave tribe of Indians. It would
afford me great pleasure, indeed, to render the desired assistance,
were it in my power so to do. But by the constitution and laws of
this state I have not the authority conferred on me to employ either
&#8216;men or means&#8217; to render this needful assistance; but
will be most happy to co-operate in this laudable undertaking in any
consistent way that may be presented. I would, however, suggest that
through the general government the attention of the Indian Department
being called to the subject, would more likely crown with success such
efforts as might be necessary to employ in attempting the rescue of the
unfortunate captive.</p>

<p class="right mr3">&#8220;Very respectfully your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right mr1">&#8220;<span class="smcap">J. Neely Johnson</span>.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, and in accordance with the above suggestion, a preamble
stating the facts, and a petition numerously signed, was drawn up
and left at the office at the Steamer Landing to be forwarded to
Washington. &#8220;Two days after,&#8221; says Lorenzo, &#8220;I had
resigned myself to patient waiting for a return of that petition, and
went to work at some distance from the Monte in the woods.&#8221; He
was still musing upon the one object of the last five years&#8217;
solicitude. A new light had broken in upon his anxious heart. He had
now some reliable information of the probable existence, though in a
barbarous captivity, of those who were bound to him by the strongest
ties.</p>

<p>He was left now to hope for their rescue, but not without painful
fears lest something might yet intervene to prevent the realization of
his new expectations. While thus engaged, alone and in the solitude
of his thoughts, as well as of the wilderness, a friend rode up to
him, and without speaking handed him a copy of the &#8220;Los Angeles
Star,&#8221; pointing at the same time to a notice contained in it. He
opened it, and read as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>An American Woman rescued from the Indians!</i>&mdash;A woman,
giving her name as Miss Olive Oatman, has been recently rescued from
the Mohaves, and is now at Fort Yuma.&#8221;</p>

<p>After getting this short note he took a horse and went immediately
to Los Angeles. He went to the editor, and found that a letter
had been received by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249"
id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> him from Commander Burke, at Fort Yuma,
stating that a young woman, calling herself &#8220;Olive Oatman,&#8221;
had been recently brought into the fort by a Yuma Indian, who had been
rescued from the Mohave tribe; also stating to the editor that she had
a brother who had lately been in this vicinity, and requesting the
editor to give the earliest possible notice to that brother of the
rescue of his sister. Lorenzo says:</p>

<p>&#8220;I requested him to let me see the letter, which he did. When
I came to the facts contained in it concerning my sister, I could read
no further; I was completely overcome. I laughed, I cried, I half
doubted, I believed. It did not seem to be a reality. I now thought I
saw a speedy realization, in part, of my long cherished hopes. I saw
no mention of Mary Ann, and at once concluded that the first report
obtained by way of Fort Yuma, by Yuma Indians, was probably sadly true,
that but one was alive. Too well founded were the fears I then had
that poor Mary Ann had died among the savages, either by disease or
cruelty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was without money or means to get to the fort; but there
were those who from the first had cherished a deep and active sympathy
with me, and who were ready to do all in their power to aid me in my
sorrow-strewn efforts for enslaved kindred.</p>

<p>&#8220;This same Mr. Low who had rode from Los Angeles to me near
the Monte, kindly told me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> he would assist me to obtain animals
and get them ready for me, and that he would accompany me to Fort
Yuma.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus outfitted, though not without much trembling and anxiety,
questioning as to the certainty and reality of the reports, and of the
rescued person really being his sister, yet feeling <em>it must be true</em>;
with good hope he and Mr. Low were away early on the bright morning of
the 10th of March for Fort Yuma, a distance of two hundred and fifty
miles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="hang f90">Francisco goes over the River, and spends
the Night&mdash;Persuades some of the Sub-Chiefs to apply again
for Permission to let Olive go free&mdash;His Threats&mdash;The
Chiefs return with him&mdash;Secret Council&mdash;Another General

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time Olive
had been apprised of the fact that intercourse had been kept up between
the Mohaves and the whites, as articles had been brought in, from time
to time, that she knew must have been obtained from white settlements,
either by plunder or purchase. These were brought in by small parties,
one of whom would frequently be absent several days or weeks at a
time.</p>

<p>She saw in these the evidences that she was within reach still of
the race to which she belonged; and often would gaze with interest
and curiosity upon some old tattered garment that had been brought
in, until the remembrances and associations it would awaken would
bring tears and sighs to end the bitter meditations upon that
brighter and happier people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252"
id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> now no longer hers. She ventured to ask
questions concerning these trips, and the place where they found the
whites; but all her anxious queries were met by threats and taunts,
or a long, gibberish dissertation upon the perfidy of the whites,
india-rubber stories upon the long distance of the whites away, or a
restatement of their malignant hate toward them, and of their purpose
to use the knowledge they might gain by these professed friendly
visits to their ultimate overthrow, by treachery and deceit. They
even professed to disbelieve the statements that had so long deceived
them concerning the numerical strength of the whites, and to believe
that the few of them yet remaining could and would be overcome and
extinguished by the combined power of the Indian tribes, that at no
distant day would be directed against them.</p>

<p>The chief&#8217;s daughter, however, ventured to tell Olive, under
injunction of secrecy, that some of their number knew well and had
frequently traversed the road leading to white settlements; but that
it was an immense distance, and that none but Indians could find it;
besides that it was guarded by vigilant spies against the incoming of
any but their own race.</p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that as yet Olive had been forbidden
a word with Francisco. We left the narrative of Olive, in another
chapter, involved in the heated and angry debates of a long and
tedious council. Upon that wild council she had been waiting<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> in
dreadful suspense, not a little mingled with terrible forebodings
of her own personal safety. This convention came to a conclusion
with a positive and peremptory refusal to liberate the captive; and
a resolution to send Francisco away, under injunction not again,
under penalty of torture, to revisit their camp. Francisco, on the
same night, departed to the other side of the river; the chiefs and
sub-chiefs dispersed, and Olive was left to her own melancholy musings
over the probable result.</p>

<p>She now began to regret that anything had been said or done about
her rescue. She was in darkness as to the effect that all this new
excitement upon her stay among them might have, after it should become
a matter of sober deliberation by the Mohaves alone. She saw and heard
enough, directly and indirectly, to know that they were set upon not
letting her go free. She began to fear for her life, especially as she
saw the marked changes in the conduct of the Indians toward her. The
wife of the chief seemed to feel kind still toward her; but yet she
plainly evinced that the doings of the last few days had compelled her
to disguise her real feelings. The chief was changed from a pleasant
don&#8217;t-care spectator of Olive&#8217;s situation, to a sullen,
haughty, overbearing tyrant and oppressor.</p>

<p>Olive was now shut up to a newly enkindled hate, which sought
opportunities to fume its wrath against her. She now regarded all
efforts for her rescue as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254"
id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> having reached a final and abrupt close.
But still she could not be ignorant, concealed and reserved as they
were in all their mutual consultations, of the fact that some dreadful
fear for themselves was galling and tormenting them. Expressions that
she well understood, and conveying their dread of the whites, and fear
that they might execute the threats brought by Francisco, constantly
escaped them, and came to the ears of the agitated subject and victim
of their new rage.</p>

<p>Francisco spent the night upon which the council closed across the
river. He there plied every argument and stratagem that his cunning
mind could devise to persuade the principal men on that side of the
Colorado to recede from the resolution they had that day reached. He
employed the whole night in setting before them troubles that these
rash resolutions would bring upon them, and to convince them that it
was for their sakes alone that he desired to bear the captive to the
fort with him.</p>

<p>He had resolved in his own mind not to leave without her, as she
afterward learned; and, on the failure of all other means, to risk his
life in a bold attempt to steal her away under darkness of night. But
in the morning he made preparations for leaving, (he really intended
to go back to the village,) when the magnates and councilmen, among
whom he had tarried for the night, came to him, and prevailed upon
him to go back with them, promising him that<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> they had <em>now</em>
determined to do all in their power to persuade the chief and tribe to
yield to his demand, and to let the captive go; fearing for the result
to themselves of the contrary determination already reached.</p>

<p>About noon of the next day Olive saw Francisco, with a large number
of Mohaves, come into the village. It was not without much fear and
alarm that she saw this, though such had been the intense anxiety about
her situation, and the possibility of escape that the last few days
had enkindled, she felt willing to have a final conclusion now formed,
whether it should be her death or release.</p>

<p>To live much longer there, she now thought she plainly saw would
be impossible; as she could only expect to be sold or barbarously
dispatched, after all that had passed upon the question of her release.
Besides this she felt that with the knowledge she had now gained of
the nearness and feeling of the whites, it would be worse than death
to be doomed to the miseries of her captivity, almost in sight of the
privileges of her native land. And hence, though the reappearance
of Francisco was an occasion for new tumult, and her own agitation
intense, she felt comforted in the prospect it opened of ending the
period of her present living death.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Francisco returned I was out gathering ottileka, (a
small ground-nut of the size of the hazel-nut,) and had utterly
abandoned the hope of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256"
id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> released, as the council had broken up
with an utter refusal to let me go. Had I known all that had transpired
I should have felt much worse than as it was. I learned from Francisco
since, that the Indians had resolved (those who were friendly to my
going) that for fear that the whites would come to rescue me, they
would kill me as soon as it was decided I should not go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not as yet seen the letter that Francisco brought to
me. I plainly saw a change in the conduct of the Indians to me since
the close of the recent agitation. What it foretold I could not even
conjecture. But I saw enough before swinging my basket that morning
upon my back to go out digging ottileka, to convince me that the wrath
of many of them was aroused. I struggled to suppress any emotion I
felt, while my anxious heart was beating over possible dreaded results
of this kind attempt to rescue me, which I thought I saw were to be of
a very different character from those intended.&#8221;</p>

<p>The returning company came immediately to the house of the chief. At
first the chief refused to receive them. After a short secret council
with some members of his cabinet, he yielded; the other chiefs were
called, and with Francisco they were again packed in council. The
criers were again hurried forth, and the tribe was again convened.</p>

<p>At this council Olive was permitted to remain. The speaking was
conducted with a great deal of confusion, which the chief found it
difficult to prevent; speakers were frequently interrupted, and at
times there was a wild, uproarious tumult, and a heated temper and
heated speech were the order of the day. Says Olive:</p>

<p>&#8220;It did seem during that night, at several stages of the
debate, that there was no way of preventing a general fight among them.
Speeches were made, which, judging from their gestures and motions, as
well as from what I could understand in their heat and rapidity, were
full of the most impassioned eloquence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found that they had told Francisco that I was not an
American, that I was from a race of people much like the Indians,
living away to the setting sun. They had painted my face, and feet, and
hands of a dun, dingy color, unlike that of any race I ever saw. This
they told me they did to deceive Francisco; and that I must not talk
to him in American. They told me to talk to him in another language,
and to tell him that I was not an American. They then waited to hear
the result, expecting to hear my gibberish nonsense, and to witness
the convincing effect upon Francisco. But I spoke to him in broken
English, and told him the truth, and also what they had enjoined me to
do. He started from his seat in a perfect rage, vowing that he would be
imposed upon no longer. He then broke forth upon them with one of the
most vehement addresses I ever heard. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> and still feel an
anxiety to know the full contents of that speech. Part of it he gave me
on the way to the fort. It was full of eloquence, and was an exhibition
of talent rarely found among his race.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Mohave warriors threatened to take my life for disobeying
their orders. They were doubly chagrined that their scheme had failed,
and also that their dishonest pretensions of my unwillingness to go
with him, and of my not being an American, had been found out. Some of
them persisted still in the falsehood, saying that I had learned some
American from living among them, but that I had told them that I was
not of that race. All this transpired after Francisco&#8217;s return,
and during his second and last effort for my rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I narrowly looked at Francisco, and soon found he was one
whom I had seen there before, and who had tarried with the chief about
three months previously. I saw he held a letter in his hand and asked
to let me see it. Toward morning it was handed me, and Francisco told
me it was from the Americans. I took it, and after a little made out
the writing on the outside.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;FRANCISCO, A YUMA INDIAN, GOING TO THE MOHAVES.&#8217;</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;I opened it with much agitation. All was quiet as the grave
around me. I examined it for a long time ere I could get the sense,
having seen no writing for five years. It was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Francisco</span>, Yuma Indian,
bearer of this, goes to the Mohave Nation to obtain a white woman
there, named OLIVIA. It is desirable she should come to this post, or

</div>

<p>&#8220;They now began to importune and threaten me to give them the
contents of the letter. I waited and meditated for some time. I did not
know whether it was best to give it to them just as it was. Up to this
time I had striven to manifest no anxiety about the matter. They had
questioned and teased with every art, from little children up to men,
to know my feelings, though they should have known them well by this
time. I dared not in the excitement express a wish. Francisco had told
them that the whites knew where I was, and that they were about arming
a sufficient number to surround the whole Indian nations, and that they
thus intended to destroy them all unless they gave up the last captive
among them. He told them that the men at the fort would kill himself
and all they could find of them with the Yumas, if he should not bring
her back. He said it was out of mercy to his own tribe, and to them
that he had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were still pressing me to read them the letter. I
then told them what was in it, and also that the Americans would
send a large army and destroy the Yumas and Mohaves, with all the
Indians they could find, unless I should return with Francisco.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
I never expect to address so attentive an audience again as I did
then.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found that they had been representing to Francisco that I
did not wish to go to the whites. As soon as they thought they had the
contents of the letter, there was the breaking out of scores of voices
at once, and our chief found it a troublesome meeting to preside over.
Some advised that I should be killed, and that Francisco should report
that I was dead. Others that they at once refuse to let me go, and that
the whites could not hurt them. Others were in favor of letting me
go at once. And it was not until daylight that one could judge which
counsel would prevail.</p>

<p>&#8220;In all this Francisco seemed bold, calm, and determined. He
would answer their questions and objections with the tact and cunning
of a pure Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be impossible to describe my own feelings on reading
that letter, and during the remainder of the pow-wow. I saw now a
reality in all that was said and done. There was the handwriting of one
of my own people, and the whole showed plainly that my situation was
known, and that there was a purpose to secure my return. I sought to
keep my emotions to myself, for fear of the effect it might have upon
my doom, to express a wish or desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this time the captive girl could only remain in the
profoundest and most painful silence, though<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> <em>the one</em> of all the
agitated crowd most interested in the matter and result of the debate.
Daylight came slowly up the east, finding the assembly still discussing
the life and death question (for such it really was) that had called
them together.</p>

<p>Some time after sunrise, and after Francisco and the captive had
been bid retire, the chief called them again in, and told them, with
much reluctance, that the decision had been to let the captive go.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this,&#8221; says Olive, &#8220;and while yet in their
presence, I found I could no longer control my feelings, and I
burst into tears, no longer able to deny myself the pleasure of
thus expressing the weight of feeling that struggled for relief and
utterance within me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found that it had been pleaded against my being given up,
that Francisco was suspected of simply coming to get me away from the
Mohaves that I might be retained by the Yumas. The chief accused him
of this, and said he believed it. This excited the anger of Francisco,
and he boldly told them what he thought of them, and told them to go
with their captive; that they would sorrow for it in the end. When it
was determined that I might go, the chief said that his daughter should
go and see that I was carried to the whites. We ate our breakfast,
supplied ourselves with mushed musquite, and started. Three Yuma
Indians had come with Francisco, to accompany him to and from the
Mohaves; his brother and two cousins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264"
id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I now began to think of really leaving my Indian home.
Involuntarily my eye strayed over that valley. I gazed on every
familiar object. The mountains that stood about our valley home,
like sentinels tall and bold, their every shape, color, and height,
as familiar as the door-yard about the dwelling in which I had been
reared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again my emotions were distrusted, and I could hardly believe
that what was passing was reality. &#8216;Is it true,&#8217; I asked,
&#8216;that they have concluded to let me escape? I fear they will
change their mind. Can it be that I am to look upon the white face
again?&#8217; I then felt like hastening as for my life, ere they could
revoke their decision. Their looks, their motions, their flashing eyes
reminded me that I was not out of danger. Some of them came to me and
sillily laughed, as much as to say: &#8216;O, you feel very finely now,
don&#8217;t you?&#8217; Others stood and gazed upon me with a steady,
serious look, as if taking more interest in my welfare than ever
before. More than this I seemed to read in their singular appearance;
they seemed to stand in wonder as to where I could be going. Some of
them seemed to feel a true joy that I was made so happy, and they would
speak to me to that effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;One little incident took place on the morning of my
departure, that clearly reflects the littleness and meanness that
inheres in the general character of the Indian. I had several small
strings of beads; most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265"
id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> of them had been given me for singing
to them when requested, when they had visitors from other tribes. I
purposed at once that I would take these beads, together with some
small pieces of blankets that I had obtained at different times, and
was wearing upon my person at this time, to the whites as remembrancers
of the past; but when I was about ready to start, the son of the chief
came and took all my beads, with every woolen shred he could find about
me, and quietly told me that I could not take them with me. This,
though a comparatively trifling matter, afflicted me. I found that I
prized those beads beyond their real value; especially one string that
had been worn by Mary. I had hoped to retain them while I might live. I
then gathered up a few small ground-nuts, which I had dug with my own
hands, and concealed them; and some of them I still keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>That same kind daughter of the chief who had so often in suppressed
and shy utterances spoken the word of condolence, and the wish to see
Olive sent to her native land, and had given every possible evidence
of a true and unaffected desire for her welfare, she was not sorry to
learn was to attend her upon the long and tedious trip by which her
reunion with the whites was hoped to be reached.</p>

<p>But there was one spot in that valley of captivity that possessed
a mournful attraction for the emancipated captive. Near the wigwam
where she had spent many hours in loneliness, and Indian converse<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> with
her captors, was a mound that marked the final resting-place of her
last deceased sister. Gladly would she, if it had been in her power,
have gathered the few moldering remains of that loved and cherished
form, and borne them away to a resting-place on some shaded retreat
in the soil of her own countrymen. But this privilege was denied
her, and that too while she knew that immediately upon her exit they
would probably carry their already made threats of burning them into
execution. And who would have left such a place, so enshrined in the
heart as that must have been, without a struggle, though her way from
it lay toward the home of the white man? That grave upon which she had
so often knelt, and upon which she had so often shed the bitter tear,
the only place around which affection lingered, must now be abandoned;
not to remain a place for the undisturbed repose of her sister&#8217;s
remains, but to disgorge its precious trust in obedience to the rude,
barbarous superstition that had waved its custom at the time of her
death. No wonder that she says: &#8220;I went to the grave of Mary Ann,
and took a last look of the little mound marking the resting-place of
my sister who had come with me to that lonely exile; and now I felt
what it was to know she could not go with me from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There had been in the employ of government at Fort Yuma, since
1853, a Mr. Grinell, known, from his occupation, by the name of
Carpentero. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267"
id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> man of a large heart, and of many
excellent qualities. He was a man who never aimed to put on an exterior
to his conduct that could give any deceptive impression of heart and
character. Indeed he often presented a roughness and uncouthness which,
however repulsive to the stranger, was found nevertheless, on an
acquaintance, to cover a noble nature of large and generous impulses.
A man of diligence and fidelity, he merited and won the confidence of
all who knew him. He possessed a heart that could enter into sympathy
with the subjects of suffering wherever he found them. Soon after
coming to Fort Yuma, he had learned of the fate of the Oatman family,
and of the certainty of the captivity of two of the girls. With all
the eagerness and solicitude that could be expected of a kinsman, he
inquired diligently into the particulars, and also the reliability
of the current statements concerning these unfortunate captives. Nor
did these cease in a moment or a day. He kept up a vigilant outsight,
searching to glean, if possible, something by which to reach definite
knowledge of them.</p>

<p>He was friendly to the Yumas, numbers of whom were constantly
about the fort. Of them he inquired frequently and closely. Among
those with whom he was most familiar, and who was in most favor
among the officers at the fort, was Francisco. Carpentero had about
given up the hope of accomplishing what he desired, when one night
Francisco crept by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268"
id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> means through the guard, and found his
way into the tent of his friend, long after he had retired.</p>

<p>Grinell awoke, and in alarm drew his pistol and demanded who was
there. Francisco spoke, and his voice was known. Grinell asked him
what he could be there for at that hour of the night. With an air of
indifference he said he had only come in to talk a little. After a
long silence and some suspicious movements, he broke out and said:
&#8220;Carpentero, what is this you say so much about two Americanos
among the Indians?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Said,&#8221; replied Grinell; &#8220;I said that there are
two girls among the Mohaves or Apaches, and you know it, and we know
that you know it.&#8221; Grinell then took up a copy of the Los Angeles
<cite>Star</cite>, and told Francisco to listen, and he would read him what the
Americans were saying and thinking about it. He then reads, giving
the interpretation in Mexican, (which language Francisco could speak
fluently,) an article that had been gotten up and published at the
instance of Lorenzo, containing the report brought in by Mr. Rowlit,
calling for help. The article also stated that a large number of men
were ready to undertake to rescue the captives at once, if means could
be furnished.</p>

<p>But the quick and eager mind of Carpentero did not suffer the
article to stop with what he could find in the <cite>Star</cite>; keeping his eye
still upon the paper, he continued to read, that if the captives were
not delivered in so many days, there would be five millions of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> men
thrown around the mountains inhabited by the Indians, and that they
would annihilate the last one of them, if they did not give up all the
white captives.</p>

<p>Many other things did that <cite>Star</cite> tell at that time, of a like
import, but the which had got into the paper (if there at all) without
editor, type, or ink.</p>

<p>Francisco listened with mouth, and ears, and eyes. After a short
silence, he said, (in Mexican,) &#8220;I know where there is one white
girl among the Mohaves; there were two, but one is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the generous heart of Carpentero began to swell, and the
object of his anxious, disinterested sympathy for the first time began
to present itself as a bright reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you find out she was there?&#8221; said
Carpentero.</p>

<p>F. &#8220;I have just found it out to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>C. &#8220;Did you not know it before?&#8221;</p>

<p>F. &#8220;Well, not long; me just come in, you know. Me know now she
is there among the Mohaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carpentero was not yet fully satisfied that all was right. There had
been, and still was, apprehension of some trouble at the fort, from the
Yumas; and Carpentero did not know but that some murderous scheme was
concocted, and all this was a ruse to beguile and deceive them.</p>

<p>Carpentero then told Francisco to stay in his tent for the
night. Francisco then told Carpentero that<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> if Commander Burke would
give him authority, he would go and bring the girl into the fort. That
night Carpentero slept awake. Early in the morning they went to the
commander. For some time Commander Burke was disposed to regard it as
something originated by the cunning of Francisco, and did not believe
he would bring the girl in. Said Francisco: &#8220;You give me four
blankets and some beads, and I will bring her in just twenty days, when
the sun be right over here,&#8221; pointing to about forty-five degrees
above the western horizon.</p>

<p>Carpentero begged the captain to place all that it would cost for
the outfit to his own account, and let him go. The captain consented,
a letter was written, and the Yuma, with a brother and two others,
started. This was about the eighth of February, 1856.</p>

<p>Several days passed, and the men about the fort thought they had
Carpentero in a place where it would do to remind him of &#8220;<em>his
trusty Francisco</em>.&#8221; And thus they did, asking him if he
&#8220;did not think his blankets and beads had sold cheap?&#8221; if
he &#8220;had not better send another Indian after the blankets?&#8221;
etc., with other questions indicating their own distrust of the whole
movement.</p>

<p>On the twentieth day, about noon, three Yuma Indians, living
some distance from the fort, came to the fort and asked permission
to see &#8220;a man by the name of Carpentero.&#8221; They were
shown his tent, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271"
id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> in and made themselves known, saying,
&#8220;Carpentero, Francisco is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he the girl with him?&#8221; quickly asked the agitated
Carpentero, bounding to his feet.</p>

<p>They laughed sillily, saying, &#8220;Francisco will come here when
the sun be right over there,&#8221; pointing in the direction marked by
Francisco.</p>

<p>With eager eyes Carpentero stood gazing for some time, when three
Indians and two females, dressed in closely woven bark skirts, came
down to the ferry on the opposite side of the river. At that he
bounded toward them, crying at the top of his voice, &#8220;They have
come; <em>the captive girl is here</em>!&#8221; All about the fort were soon
apprised that it was even so, and soon they were either running to meet
and welcome the captive, or were gazing with eagerness to know if this
strange report could be true.</p>

<p>Olive, with her characteristic modesty, was unwilling to appear in
her bark attire and her poor shabby dress among the whites, eager as
she was to catch again a glimpse of their countenances, one of whom she
had not seen for years. As soon as this was made known, a noble-hearted
woman, the wife of one of the officers and the lady to whose kind
hospitalities she was afterward indebted for every kindness that could
minister to her comfort the few weeks she tarried there, sent her a
dress and clothing of the best she had.</p>

<p>Amid long enthusiastic cheering and the booming<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of cannon, Miss Olive was presented to the commander of the fort by
Francisco. Every one seemed to partake of the joy and enthusiasm that
prevailed. Those who had been the most skeptical of the intentions of
Francisco, were glad to find their distrust rebuked in so agreeable
a manner. The Yumas gathered in large numbers, and seemed to partake
in the general rejoicing, joining their heavy shrill voices in the
shout, and fairly making the earth tremble beneath the thunder of their
cheering.</p>

<p>Francisco told the captain he had been compelled to give more for
the captive than what he had obtained of him; that he had promised the
Mohave chief a horse, and that his daughter was now present to see that
this promise was fulfilled. Also, that a son of the chief would be in
within a few days to receive the horse. A good horse was given him,
and each of the kind officers at the fort testified their gratitude to
him, as well as their hearty sympathy with the long separated brother
and sister, by donating freely and liberally of their money to make up
a horse for Francisco; and he was told there, in the presence of the
rest of his tribe, that he had not only performed an act for which the
gratitude of the whites would follow him, but one that might probably
save his tribe and the Mohaves much trouble and many lives.</p>

<p>From this Francisco was promoted and became a &#8220;Tie&#8221;
of his tribe, and with characteristic pride and haughtiness of
bearing, showed the capabilities of the Indian to appreciate honors and
preferment, by looking with disdain and contempt upon his peers, and
treating them thus in the presence of the whites.</p>

<p>Miss Olive was taken in by a very excellent family residing at the
fort at the time, and every kindness and tender regard bestowed upon
her that her generous host and hostess could make minister to her
contentment and comfort. She had come over three hundred and fifty
miles during the last ten days; frequently (as many as ten times) she
and her guides were compelled to swim the swollen streams, running and
rushing to the top of their banks with ice-water. The kind daughter
of the chief, with an affection that had increased with every month
and year of their association, showed more concern and eagerness for
the wellbeing of &#8220;Olivia&#8221; than her own. She would carry,
through the long and toilsome day, the roll of blankets that they
shared together during the night, and seemed very much concerned and
anxious lest something might yet prevent her safe arrival at the place
of destination.</p>

<p>Olive was soon apprised of the place of residence of her brother,
whom she had so long regarded as dead, and also of his untiring
efforts, during the last few years, for the rescue of his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was some time,&#8221; she says, &#8220;before I could
realize that he was yet alive. The last time I saw him he was dragged
in his own blood to the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276"
id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> upon the brow of that precipice; I
thought I knew him to be dead.&#8221; And it was not until all the
circumstances of his escape were detailed to her that she could fully
credit his rescue and preservation. Lorenzo and his trading companion,
Mr. Low, were about ten days in reaching the fort; each step and hour
of that long and dangerous journey his mind was haunted by the fear
that the rescued girl might not be his sister. But he had not been long
at the fort ere his trembling heart was made glad by the attestation
of his own eyes to the reality. He saw that it was his own sister (the
same, though now grown and much changed) who, with Mary Ann, had poured
their bitter cries upon his bewildered senses five years before, as
they were hurried away by the unheeding Apaches, leaving him for dead
with the rest of the family.</p>

<p>Language was not made to give utterance to the feelings that rise,
and swell, and throb through the human bosom upon such a meeting as
this. For five years they had not looked in each other&#8217;s eyes;
the last image of that brother pressed upon the eye and memory of
his affectionate sister, was one that could only make any reference
to it in her mind one of painful, torturing horror. She had seen him
when (as she supposed) life had departed, dragged in the most inhuman
manner to one side; one of a whole family who had been butchered before
her eyes. The last remembrance of that sister by her brother,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
was of her wailings and heart-rending sighs over the massacre of the
rest of her family, and her consignment to a barbarous captivity or
torturing death. She was grown to womanhood; she was changed, but
despite the written traces of her outdoor life and barbarous treatment
left upon her appearance and person, he could read the assuring
evidences of her family identity. They met, they wept, they embraced
each other in the tenderest manner; heart throbbed to heart, and pulse
beat to pulse; but for nearly one hour not one word could either
speak!</p>

<p>The past! the checkered past! with its bright and its dark, its
sorrow and its joy, rested upon that hour of speechless joy. The
season of bright childhood, their mutual toils and anxieties of nearly
one year, while traveling over that gloomy way; that horrid night of
massacre, with its wailing and praying, mingled with fiendish whooping
and yelling, remembered in connection with its rude separation; the
five years of tears, loneliness, and captivity among savages, through
which she had grown up to womanhood; the same period of his captivity
to the dominion of a harassing anxiety and solicitude, through which he
had grown up to manhood, all pressed upon the time of that meeting, to
choke utterance, and stir the soul with emotions that could only pour
themselves out in tears and sighs.</p>

<p>A large company of Americans, Indians, and Mexicans, were present
and witnessed the meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278"
id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> of Lorenzo and his sister. Some of them
are now in the city of San Francisco, to testify that not an unmoved
heart nor a dry eye witnessed it. Even the rude and untutored Indian,
raised his brawny hand to wipe away the unbidden tear that stole upon
his cheek as he stood speechless and wonder-struck! When the feelings
became controllable, and words came to their relief, they dwelt and
discoursed for hours upon the gloomy and pain-written past. In a few
days they were safe at the Mont&eacute;, and were there met by a cousin
from Rogue River Valley, Oregon, who had heard of the rescue of Olive,
and had come to take her to his own home.</p>

<p>At the Mont&eacute; they were visited during a stay of two weeks,
in waiting for the steamer, by large numbers of people, who bestowed
upon the rescued captive all possible manifestations of interest in
her welfare, and hearty rejoicing at her escape from the night of
prison-life and suffering so long endured.</p>

<p>She was taken to Jackson County, Oregon, where she has been since,
and is still residing there.</p>

<p class="p2">* Since writing the above Miss Oatman, with her
brother, have spent about six months at school in Santa Clara Valley,
California. On the fifth day of March, 1858, they left San Francisco,
in company with the writer and his family, on the steamship Golden Age,
for New-York, where they arrived on the 26th of the same month.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>How strange the life of these savages. Of their past history how
little is known; and there is an utter destitution of any reliable
data upon which to conjecture even concerning it. By some they
are considered the descendants of a people who were refined and
enlightened. That a period of civilization, and of some progress in the
arts, preceded the discovery of this continent by Columbus, there can
be but little doubt. The evidences of this are to be seen in the relics
of buried cities and towns, that have been found deep under ground in
numerous places.</p>

<p>But whether the people of whom we have these traces extended to the
Pacific slope, and to the southwest, we know not. This much we do know:
there are large tracts of country now occupied by large and numerous
tribes of the red race, living in all the filth and degradation of
an unmitigated heathenism, and without any settled system of laws or
social regulations.</p>

<p>If they have any system of government, it is that of an absolute
monarchy. The chief of each tribe is the sole head and sovereign in
all matters that affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280"
id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> the wellbeing of the same, even to the
life and death of its members.</p>

<p>They are human, but live like brutes. They seem totally destitute
of all those noble and generous traits of life which distinguish and
honor civilized people. In indolence and supineness they seem content
to pass their days, without ambition, save of war and conquest; they
live the mere creatures of passion, blind and callous to all those
ennobling aims and purposes that are the true and pleasing inspiration
of rational existence. In their social state, the more they are studied
the more do they become an object of disgust and loathing.</p>

<p>They manifest but little affection for one another, only when death
has separated them, and then they show the deep inhumanity and abject
heathenism to which they have sunk by the horrid rites that prevail in
the disposing of their infirm kindred and their dead. They burn the one
and the other with equal impunity and satisfaction.</p>

<p>The marriage relation among them is not honored, scarcely observed.
The least affront justifies the husband in casting off his chosen wife,
and even in taking her life. Rapine and lust prey upon them at home;
and war is fast wasting them abroad. They regard the whites as enemies
from all antiquity, and any real injury they can do them is considered
a virtue, while the taking of their lives (especially of males) is
an act which is sure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281"
id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> crown the name of the perpetrator with
eternal honors.</p>

<p>With all their boasting and professed contempt for the whites, and
with all their bright traditions and prophecies, according to which
their day of triumph and power is near at hand, yet they are not
without premonitions of a sad and fatal destiny. They are generally
dejected and cast down; the tone of their every-day life, as well as
sometimes actual sayings, indicating a pressing fear and harassing
foreboding.</p>

<p>Some of the females would, after hours of conversation with Olive,
upon the character, customs, and prosperity of the whites, plainly,
but with injunctions of secrecy, tell her that they lived in constant
fear; and it was not unfrequent that some disaffected member of the
tribe would threaten to leave his mountain home and go to live with the
whites. It is not to be understood that this was the prevailing state
of feeling among them.</p>

<p>Most of them are sunk in an ignorance that forbids any aspiration
or ambition to reach or fire their natures; an ignorance that knows
no higher mode of life than theirs, and that looks with jealousy upon
every nation and people, save the burrowing tribes that skulk and crawl
among these mountains and ravines.</p>

<p>But fate seems descending upon them, if not in &#8220;sudden,&#8221;
yet in certain night. They are waning.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> Remnants of them will
no doubt long survive; but the masses of them seem fated to a speedy
decay. Since this narrative was first written, a very severe battle,
lasting several weeks, has taken place between the allied Mohaves and
Yumas on the one side, and the Cochopas on the other. The former lost
over three hundred warriors; the latter but few, less than threescore.
Among the slain was the noble Francisco. It is rumored at Fort Yuma,
that during the engagement the allied tribes were informed by their
oracles that their ill-success was owing to Francisco; that he must be
slain for his friendship to the whites; then victory would crown their
struggles; and that, in obedience to this superstition, he was slain by
the hands of his own tribe.</p>

<p>Had Olive been among them during this unsuccessful war, her life
would have been offered up on the return of the defeated warriors; and
no doubt there were then many among them who attributed their defeat to
the conciliation on their part by which she was surrendered to her own
people. Such is the Indian of the South and Southwest.</p>

<p>We have tried to give the reader a correct, though brief history
of the singular and strange fate of that unfortunate family. If there
is one who shall be disposed to regard the reality as overdrawn,
we have only to say that every fact has been dictated by word of
mouth from the surviving members of that once happy family, who
have, by a mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283"
id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> Providence, after suffering a prolonged
and unrelieved woe of five years, been rescued and again restored to
the blessings of a civilized and sympathizing society.</p>

<p>Most of the preceding pages have been written in the first person.
This method was adopted for the sake of brevity, as also to give,
as near as language may do it, a faithful record of the <em>feelings</em>
and <em>spirit</em> with which the distresses and cruel treatment of the
few years over which these pages run, was met, braved, endured, and
triumphed over. The record of the five years of captivity entered upon
by a timid, inexperienced girl of fourteen years, and during which,
associated with naught but savage life, she grew up to womanhood,
presents one of heroism, self-possession, and patience, that might do
honor to one of maturity and years. Much of that dreadful period is
unwritten, and will remain forever unwritten.</p>

<p>We have confidence that every reader will share with us the feelings
of gratitude to Almighty God for the blessings of civilization, and
a superior social life, with which we cease to pen this record of
the degradation, the barbarity, the superstition, the squalidness,
that curse the uncounted thousands who people the caverns and wilds
that divide the Eastern from the Western inheritance of our mother
republic.</p>

<p>But the unpierced heathenism that thus stretches<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> its
wing of night upon these swarming mountains and vales, is not long to
have a dominion so wild, nor possess victims so numerous. Its territory
is already begirt with the light of a higher life; and now the
foot-fall of the pioneering, brave Anglo-Saxon is heard upon the heel
of the savage, and breaks the silence along his winding trail. Already
the song and shout of civilization wakes echoes long and prophetic upon
those mountain rocks, that have for centuries hemmed in an unvisited
savageness.</p>

<p>Until his death Francisco, by whose vigilance the place of
Olive&#8217;s captivity and suffering was ascertained, and who dared
to bargain for her release and restoration ere he had changed a word
with her captors about it, was hunted by his own and other tribes for
guiding the white man to the hiding-places of those whose ignorance
will not suffer them to let go their filth and superstition, and who
regard the whole transaction as the opening of the door to the greedy,
aggressive, white race. The cry of gold, like that which formed and
matured a state upon this far-off coast in a few years, is heard along
ravines that have been so long exclusively theirs, and companies of
gold hunters, led on by faint but unerring &#8220;prospects,&#8221;
are confidently seeking rich leads of the precious ore near their long
isolated wigwams.</p>

<p>The march of American civilization, if unhampered<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> by
the weakness and corruption of its own happy subjects, will yet, and
soon, break upon the barbarity of these numerous tribes, and either
elevate them to the unappreciated blessings of a superior state, or
wipe them into oblivion, and give their long-undeveloped territory to
another.</p>

<p>Perhaps when the intricate and complicated events that mark and
pave the way to this state of things, shall be pondered by the curious
and retrospective eye of those who shall rejoice in its possession,
these comparatively insignificant ones spread out for the reader
upon these pages, will be found to form a part. May Heaven guide the
anxious-freighted future to the greatest good of the abject heathen,
and save those into whose hands are committed such openings and
privileges for beneficent doing, from the perversion of their blessings
and mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honor to whom honor is due.&#8221; With all the degradation
in which these untamed hordes are steeped, there are&mdash;strange as
it may seem&mdash;some traits and phases in their conduct which, on
comparison with those of some who call themselves civilized, ought to
crimson their cheeks with a blush. While feuds have been kindled, and
lives have been lost&mdash;innocent lives&mdash;by the intrusion of
the white man upon the domestic relations of Indian families; while
decency and chastity have been outraged, and the Indian female, in some
instances, stolen from her spouse and husband that she really<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
loved; let it be written, written if possible so as to be read when an
inscrutable but unerring Providence shall exact &#8220;to the uttermost
farthing&#8221; for every deed of cruelty and lust perpetrated by a
superior race upon an inferior one; <em>written</em> to stand out before
those whose duty and position it shall be, within a few years, in
the American Council of State, to deliberate and legislate upon the
best method to dispose of these fast waning tribes; that <i>one of our
own race, in tender years, committed wholly to their power, passed a
five-years&#8217; captivity among these savages without falling under
those baser propensities which rave, and rage, and consume, with the
fury and fatality of a pestilence, among themselves</i>.</p>

<p>It is true that their uncultivated and untempered traditional
superstitions allow them to mark in the white man an enemy that has
preyed upon their rights from antiquity, and to exact of him, when
thrown into their power, cruelties that kindle just horror in the
breast of the refined and the civilized. It is true that the more
intelligent, and the large majority, deplore the poor representation of
our people that has been given to these wild men by certain &#8220;lewd
fellows of the baser sort,&#8221; who are undistinguished by them
from our race as a whole. But they are set down to our account in a
more infallible record than any of mere human writ; and delicate and
terrible is the responsibility with which<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> they have clothed the
action of the American race amid the startling and important exigences
that must roll upon its pathway for the next few years.</p>

<p>Who that looks at the superstition, the mangled, fragmentary, and
distorted traditions that form the only tribunal of appeal for the
little <em>wreck of moral sense</em> they have left them&mdash;superstitions
that hold them as with the grasp of omnipotence; who that looks upon
the self-consuming workings of the corruptions that breed in the hotbed
of ignorance, can be so hardened that his heart has no <em>sigh to heave,
no groan to utter</em> over a social, moral, and political desolation that
ought to appeal to our commiseration rather than put a torch to our
slumbering vengeance.</p>

<p>It is true that this coast and the Eastern states have now their
scores of lonely wanderers, mournful and sorrow-stricken mourners, over
whose sky has been cast a mantle of gloom that will stretch to their
tombs for the loss of those of their kindred who sleep in the dust, or
bleach upon the sand-plots trodden by these roaming heathen; kindred
who have in their innocence fallen by cruelty. But there is a voice
coming up from these scattered, unmonumented resting-places of their
dead; and it pleads, pleads with the potency and unerringness of those
pleadings from &#8220;<em>under the ground</em>&#8221; of ancient date, and of
the fact and effect of which we have a guiding record.</p>

<p>Who that casts his eye over the vast territory that lies between
the Columbia River and Acapulco, with<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> the Rocky Range for its
eastern bulwark, a territory abounding with rich verdure-clad vales
and pasturage hill-sides, and looks to the time, not distant, when
over it all shall be spread the wing of the eagle, when the music of
civilization, of the arts, of the sciences, of the mechanism, of the
religion of our favored race, shall roll along its winding rivers and
over its beautiful slopes, but has one prayer to offer to the God of
his fathers, that the same wisdom craved and received by them to plant
his civil light-house on a wilderness shore, may still guide us on to a
glorious, a happy, and a useful destiny.</p>

kindred and equally fervent strains poured upon the ear and heart of
the once suffering subject of this narrative.</p>

<p>[The following notices of this work are selected from among a large
number, all of which speak in commendation of it as a tale of thrilling
interest.]</p>

<p class="f90"><span class="smcap">An Interesting
Book.</span>&mdash;Our friend, Mr. L. D. Oatman, has laid upon our
table a thrilling narrative of the captivity of his sisters, and of
his own escape from the dreadful massacre of his family. The work is
compiled by the Rev. R. B. Stratton, and in forcible description,
purity of style, and deep interest, surpasses any production of
romance. It will be read with pleasure by many in our valley to whom
the interesting subjects of the narrative, Miss Olive and her brother,
are personally known.&mdash;<cite>Table Rock Sentinel.</cite></p>

<p class="f90 p2"><span class="smcap">Captivity of the Oatman
Girls.</span>&mdash;&#8220;We are under obligations to Randall &amp;
Co. for a copy of this little work by R. B. Stratton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you read,&#8221; says a correspondent, &#8220;the deeply
pathetic narrative of the captivity of the Oatman girls, the miraculous
escapes of a little brother, and the massacre of the rest of the
family? If not, do so at once, and extend its circulation by noticing
it in your paper. The work, which is no fiction, will be profitably
perused as a matter of curiosity and information; but in opening up the
closed fountains in the hardened hearts of our callous-grown people, it
is calculated to have a most happy effect. Who, unless the last spark
of generous sentiment and tender emotion be extinct in their natures,
can get through that little book without feeling their eyes moisten and
their bosoms swell.&#8221; Randall &amp; Co. have the work for sale;
also G. &amp; O. Amy.&mdash;<cite>Marysville Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="f90 p2"><span class="smcap">Miss Olive
Oatman.</span>&mdash;The interesting narrative of the captivity
of this young lady by the Apache Indians, and her long residence
among them and the Mohaves, so long looked for by the public,
has made its appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2a"
id="Page_2a">[2]</a></span> The book will have an extensive sale, being
written in an attractive style, and disclosing many interesting traits
of character in savage life along our southern border.&mdash;<cite>San Jose
Telegraph.</cite></p>

<p class="f90 p2"><span class="smcap">Captivity of the Oatman
Girls&mdash;Life among the Indians.</span>&mdash;This is the subject
of a volume of two hundred and ninety pages, recently issued from the
press of this city by Rev. R. B. Stratton, to whom the facts were
communicated by Olive and Lorenzo D. Oatman, the surviving members of
the family. The Oatman family, it will be recollected, were attacked by
the Apaches in 1850, and the two girls, Olive and Mary, were carried
into captivity. Mary died, but Olive was released about a year since.
The author claims for the work no great literary excellence, but rests
its merits solely upon the highly interesting nature of the facts
presented, and a strict adherence to truth throughout the narrative. A
solid cord of romance might be built upon it.&mdash;<cite>Golden Era, San
Francisco.</cite></p>

<p class="f90 p2"><span class="smcap">Captivity of the Oatman
Girls.</span>&mdash;The above is the partial title of a new California
book just issued from the press of San Francisco. It is a neat volume
of two hundred and ninety pages, and is a graphic description of one of
the most horrid tales of massacre, captivity, and death we have read
for years. The public have been anxiously waiting for this book since
the announcement a few months since that it was in preparation. The
author, Rev. R. B. Stratton, has presented the facts as he received
them from Miss Oatman, in a clear, attractive style. Of the particular
circumstances of the fate of the Oatman family most in this state are
apprised. The book will have a wide sale. Read it.&mdash;<cite>Sacramento
Union.</cite></p>

<p class="f90 p2"><span class="smcap">A New Book.</span>&mdash;We
have just received the book of the &#8220;Captivity of the Oatman
Girls,&#8221; for which the people have been looking anxiously for
several weeks. It is a tale of horrors, and well told. The reader will
rise from its perusal with a feeling prompting him to seize the musket
and go at once and chastise those inhuman wretches among whom Olive
has spent five years. The American people ought to go and give them a
whipping. Read the book. Though it is one of horrors, its style and
truthfulness attract to a thorough reading.&mdash;<cite>Democratic State

<p class="center">TESTIMONY OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p class="f90"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Among</span> the first of our
noble army of occupation in California was the Rev. William Taylor.
In labors he has been more abundant, and as fearless as laborious.
His book, as a book of mere incident and adventure, possesses
uncommon interest; but as a record of missionary toil and success its
interest is immensely increased. The sketches of personal character
and death-bed scenes are thrilling.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Ladies&#8217;
Repository.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;The observation and experience recorded abounds
with the most pleasing interest, and the scenes are described with much
graphic power and felicity.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Baltimore Sun.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;This is a graphic description of the labors of a
missionary among the most complex, and perhaps most wicked, and at the
same time excited and active population in the world. It is a very rich
book, and deserves a large sale.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Zion&#8217;s Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;As a religious history, it occupies a new
department in Californian literature; and its incidents and triumphant
death scenes are of the most interesting character.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>The
American Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;It is a very entertaining volume, full of
adventure, grave and gay, in the streets of a new city, and among a
peculiar people.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>New-York Observer.</cite></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2b" id="Page_2b">[2]</a></span></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;This work is valuable, not merely from its very
sincere and sound religious spirit, but from the curious popular
traits which it imbodies, and the remarkable insight it affords into
the striking and highly attractive peculiarities of the Methodist
denomination. We defy any student of human nature, any man gifted
with a keen appreciation of remarkable development of character,
to read this book without a keen relish. He will find in it many
singular developments of the action of religious belief allied to
manners, customs, and habits all eminently worthy of study. The
straightforward common sense of the author, allied to his faith,
has resulted in a shrewd enthusiasm, whose workings are continually
manifest, and which enforces our respect for his earnestness and piety,
as well as affording rare materials for analysis and reflection. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the author is often pleasant enough; in
some instances we find it truly touching.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia
Bulletin.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;We like the spirit and daring of the author
of this book. But few like him live among men. With an undoubted
piety, and courage like a lion, he preached Christ at a time, in San
Francisco, when Satan reigned about as triumphant as he ever has on any
other spot of the cursed earth. The book will be read, and it will do
good wherever it is read.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Buffalo Chr. Advocate.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;This book is a real contribution to the religious
history of that country. For raciness of style it is one of the most
readable books that has fallen into our hands.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Pittsburgh

<p class="f90">&#8220;The state of society which Mr. Taylor describes
is almost anomalous, and his pictures are boldly and clearly
drawn&#8221;&mdash;<cite>New York Evening Post.</cite></p>

the Western, Southern, and Richmond Christian Advocates, Christian

<p class="f90">The London Review for April, 1858, devotes nearly
four pages to &#8220;<cite>Seven Years&#8217; Street Preaching in San
Francisco</cite>,&#8221; from which the following is an extract: &#8220;The
appearance of Mr. Taylor&#8217;s work on street preaching, at a time
when so much attention is turned to this subject, when parochial
clergymen, and even bishops, have caught the mantle of Whitefield
and the Wesleys, is singularly opportune. And the book itself is
so thoroughly good, so deeply interesting, and so replete with
wise counsels and examples of what street preaching ought to be,
that we cannot but wish for it a wide circulation. The writer
tells his story with the simplicity and directness of a child; and
the incidents related are of a most unusual and romantic kind.
Too much cannot be said in praise of the nervous, plain, vigorous
style of the author&#8217;s preaching. For clearness, directness,
and force, the specimens given in this book have never been
surpassed.&#8221;&mdash;Pp. 99, 100.</p>

<p class="ph2">California Life Illustrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Taylor, as our readers may see by consulting our synopsis
of the Quarterlies, is accepted on both sides of the Atlantic, as well
as on the shores of the Pacific, as a regular &#8216;pioneer.&#8217;
The readers of his former work will find the interest aroused by
its pages amply sustained in this. Its pictorial illustrations aid
in bringing California before us.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Methodist Quarterly
Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;For stirring incidents in missionary life and labors, it
is equal to his former work, while a wider field of observation
furnishes a still more varied store of useful and curious information
in regard to California. It will well repay the reader for the time
he may spend on its bright pages. The publishers have done their part
well. The book is 12mo., in good style of binding, and printed on fair
paper.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Pittsburgh Advocate.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is a work of more general interest than the author&#8217;s
&#8216;Seven Years&#8217; Street Preaching in San Francisco.&#8217;
It enters more largely into domestic matters, manners, and modes of
living. Life in the city, the country, &#8216;the diggings,&#8217;
mining operations, the success and failures, trials, temptations, and
crimes, and all that, fill the book, and attract the reader along
its pages with an increasing interest. It is at once instructive and
entertaining.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Richmond Christian Advocate.</i></p>

<p class="f90">Rev. <span class="smcap">Dr. Crooks</span>, of New-York,
after a careful reading of California Life Illustrated, recorded his
judgment as follows: &#8220;This is not a volume of mere statistics,
but a series of pictures of the many colored life of the Golden
State. The author was for seven years engaged as a missionary in
San Francisco, and in the discharge of his duties was brought into
contact with persons of every class and shade of character. We know
of no work which gives so clear an impression of a state of society
which is already passing away, but must constitute one of the most
remarkable chapters in our nation&#8217;s history. The narrative is
life-like, and incident and sketch follow in such rapid succession,
that it is impossible for the reader to feel weary. This book, and
the author&#8217;s &#8216;<cite>Young America</cite>,&#8217; and &#8216;<cite>Seven
Years&#8217; Street Preaching in San Francisco</cite>,&#8217; would make
highly entertaining and instructive volumes for Sunday-school
libraries. Their graphically described scenes, and fine moral tone, fit
them admirably for the minds of youth.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4b"
id="Page_4b">[4]</a></span></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;Full of interesting and instructive information,
abounding in striking incident, this is a book that everybody will
be interested in reading. Indeed scarcely anything can be found
that will give a more picturesque and striking view of life in
California.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>New-York Observer.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;Mr. Taylor has recently published a work entitled
<cite>California Life Illustrated</cite>, which is one of the most interesting
books we ever read&mdash;full of stirring incident. Those who wish to
see California life, without the trouble of going thither, can get a
better idea, especially of its religious aspects, from this and the
former book of Mr. Taylor on the subject, than from any other source
conveniently accessible.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Editor of Christian Advocate and
Journal, N. Y.</i></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;The influx of nations into California, in
response to the startling intelligence that its mountains were full
of solid gold, opened up a chapter in human history that had never
before been witnessed. At first it seemed as if &#8216;the root of
all evil,&#8217; did indeed shoot into a baneful shade, under which
none of the virtues could breathe; but soon Christianity and Gospel
missionaries begun to be seen. Among the most active of them was
William Taylor, who now, on a return to the Atlantic States, gives to
the world a description of what he saw. It is an original, instructive
book, full of facts and good food for thought, and as such we heartily
commend it.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Zion&#8217;s Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;It is a series of sketches, abounding in
interesting and touching incidents of missionary life, dating with
the early history of the country, and the great gold excitement of
1849, and up, for several years, illustrating, as with the pencil of
a master in his art, the early phases of civil and social life, as
they presented themselves, struggling for being and influence amid
the conflicting elements of gold mania, fostered by licentiousness
and unchecked by the sacred influence of religion, family, and home;
containing a striking demonstration of the refining, purifying
tendencies of female influence, rendered sanctifying, when pervaded by
religion; giving such an insight into the secret workings of the human
heart and mind as will be in vain sought for in the books called mental
and moral philosophy; withdrawing the vail which ordinarily screens
the emotions of the soul, leaving the patient student to look calmly
at the very life pulsations of humanity, and grow wise. Statistically
the work is of great value to those seeking information concerning the
country, with a view to investment or settlement.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Texas
Advocate.</cite></p>

<p class="f90">&#8220;The author of this volume is favorably known to
many readers by his previous work, in which he relates the experience
of seven years&#8217; street preaching in San Francisco. He here
continues the inartificial but graphic sketches which compose the
substance of this volume, and, by his simple narratives, gives a
lively illustration of the social condition of California. During
his residence in that state he was devoted exclusively to his work
as a missionary of the Methodist Church, and, by his fearlessness,
zeal, and self-denial, won the confidence of the whole population.
He was frequently thrown in contact with gamblers, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaliers
d&#8217;industrie</i>, and adventurers of every description, but he
never shrunk from the administration of faithful rebuke, and in so
doing often won the hearts of the most abandoned. His visits to the
sick in the hospitals were productive of great good. Unwearied in his
exertions, he had succeeded in establishing a system of wholesome
religious influences when the great financial crash in San Francisco
interrupted his labors, and made it expedient for him to return to
this region in order to obtain resources for future action. His book
was, accordingly, written in the interests of a good cause, which will
commend it to the friends of religious culture in California, while its
own intrinsic vivacity and naturalness will well reward the general
reader for its perusal.&#8221;&mdash;<cite>Harper&#8217;s New Monthly

<p class="hanging">The first part of this work is an outline of the controversy on Church government

his volume by a brilliant preface; a sufficient endorsement. There is no
possibility of giving an outline of such a work; suffice it to say that the dramatis
person&aelig; are numerous and well sustained; that the martial idea of the allegory
is maintained with much spirit and brave movement, and that the general style of
the performance is quite up to its main idea.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
